1	mideast politics have calmed down and the squabbling within the organization of petroleum exporting countries seems under control for now	the fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices
1	the current equilibrium is fragile and depends on steady strong demand and continued relative harmony within opec producer of more than 40% of the non-communist world's crude	a recession or new opec blowup could put oil markets right back in the soup
1	also the new stirrings are faint and some question their extent	drilling activity is still far below eight years ago there's no hiring surge and some companies continue to shrink
1	it doesn't appear to be getting worse	that in itself has got to cause people to feel a little more optimistic
1	though modest the change reaches beyond the oil patch too	the same roller-coaster prices that halted u.s. oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation's inflation rate the trade deficit and oil users' corporate and personal budgets
1	and consumers should be comfortable	i don't see anything on the horizon that could lead to a precipitous rise in the price
1	the catalyst for all this has been opec	about a year ago it ended an on-again off-again internal production war that had put prices on a roller coaster and pitched oil towns from houston to caracas into recession
1	for opec that's ideal	the resulting firm prices and stability will allow both producers and consumers to plan confidently
1	the resulting firm prices and stability will allow both producers and consumers to plan confidently	consumers offer security of markets while opec provides security of supply
1	at its november meeting it will try to revise its quotas to satisfy persian gulf members that can produce far more oil than their allotments	being held well below capacity greatly irritates them and has led to widespread cheating
1	being held well below capacity greatly irritates them and has led to widespread cheating	opec has repeatedly raised its self-imposed production ceiling to legitimize some of that unauthorized output
1	mitchell energy & development corp. became the partner ponying up more than half of the $600 000 in drilling and start-up costs	mitchell will get a half-interest in the oil
1	at this price $18 plus or minus and with costs being significantly less than they were several years ago the economics are pretty good	if you know you've got stability in price you can do things you wouldn't do with the volatility of the past few years
1	still there is money to be made	most oil companies when they set exploration and production budgets for this year forecast revenue of $15 for each barrel of crude produced
1	outside investors scarce since '86 are edging back	although it's still difficult to raise money for a pure wildcat program institutions are starting to see there are cycles to these things and this one is beginning to turn
1	already it's hard to get people	they're so busy
1	that there certainly isn't any drilling boom	only 14 505 wells including 4 900 dry holes were drilled for oil and natural gas in the u.s. in the first nine months of the year down 22.4% from the like 1988 period
1	for zel herring owner and a cook at the sandhills luncheon cafe a tin building in midtown all this has made for a very good year	after 11:30 a.m. or so we have them standing and waiting
1	i want to add one more truck	i sense that it's going to continue to grow
1	he often groans he says at the clutter of sports stories about drugs alcohol gambling and some player's lament about the miserly millions he is offered to play the game. his morning paper the washington post even carries a sports column called jurisprudence that recounts the latest arrests and convictions of players and team managers	like many sports buffs mr. engelken has turned cynic
1	thomson took a called strike	the tension mounted as ralph branca again on the mound stared down the batter
1	and then with a crack of the bat was sent rocketing back into the lower leftfield stands	giants fans went into euphoria
1	and there he was the hero of my youth the one person in history i'd most like to meet	keep your thomas jeffersons or st. augustines or michelangelos
1	keep your thomas jeffersons or st. augustines or michelangelos	i'd take baseball's flying scot without hesitation
1	on the way home it took concentrated effort to keep that car pointed south	my mind was miles north at a place called coogan's bluff where a real sports hero had captured the imagination of a kid who never fully grew up and is all the richer for it
1	take heart sports fans	real heroes exist
1	with these incentives demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it	it seems to me we're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for criminality out of it
1	frankly the only way i can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost	when you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives
1	sometimes at a reception or cocktail party i advance these views and people head for somebody else	they don't even want to talk to you
1	they don't even want to talk to you	i know that i'm shouting into the breeze here as far as what we're doing now
1	but i feel that if somebody doesn't get up and start talking about this now the next time around when we have the next iteration of these programs it will still be true that everyone is scared to talk about it	no politician wants to say what i just said not for a minute
1	that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its 80486 microprocessor chip's floating-point unit a set of circuits that do certain calculations	on friday intel began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations
1	the flaws don't affect them	bugs like this are just a normal part of product development
1	it had corrected the problems and would start producing bugless chips next week	we should not be seeing any more
1	these errata do not affect business programs	the bugs will cause problems in specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications such as word-processing and spreadsheets
1	it's real strength lies in its software inheritance	the 486 is the descendant of a long series of intel chips that began dominating the market ever since ibm picked the 16-bit 8088 chip for its first personal computer
1	of the big computer makers only apple computer co. bases its machines on motorola chips instead	the 486 is going to have a big impact on the industry
1	the 486 is going to have a big impact on the industry	it's going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for the next few years
1	traders now routinely check the futures markets in chicago before they buy or sell stocks	when chicago futures prices jump up or down the new york stock exchange follows
1	paul lesutis blames futures markets for leading the way	the fundamentals don't change in an hour
1	the fundamentals don't change in an hour	they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing
1	index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures -- is frequently blamed for adding to stock market volatility	although index arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets john bachmann managing partner of edward d. jones says too much liquidity isn't a good thing
1	blaming futures is like blaming the messenger	since stock-index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets it can't add to volatility
1	futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios	if managers fear that the overall stock market will fall but want to continue owning stocks they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts
1	futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios	if managers fear that the overall stock market will fall but want to continue owning stocks they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts
1	margin requirements for speculators on the chicago mercantile exchange are currently about 7%	for $10 million you can move $100 million of stocks
1	for $10 million you can move $100 million of stocks	that gives futures traders a lot more power
1	the s&p 500 index futures transferred the identity of 500 stocks into one unit-making them a simple commodity to trade	it took away the need to know the bad third-quarter report of ibm for example
1	futures on the other hand are a zero sum game -- a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices	you don't own anything
1	thus rather than seeing the excess returns to the pro-selected portfolio as being abnormal i see those returns as simply compensations for taking on added risk	the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large
1	moreover your hypothetical investor has forsaken the gains to be had in reducing risk by diversifying his portfolio	a four-stock portfolio is still exposed to a great deal of unnecessary risk
1	your investment dartboard article misses the target	the fact that stock pickers have bested a randomly selected portfolio in eight of 12 months has no bearing on the efficient-market theory
1	but its unsentimental sketches of cairo life are vintage mahfouz	we see smell and hear slums filled with the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street
1	the prose is closer to balzac's pere goriot than it is to arabian nights	mr. mahfouz began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in arabic and he modeled his work on western classics
1	mr. mahfouz began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in arabic and he modeled his work on western classics	in one sense this limits him
1	in one sense this limits him	unlike a writer such as gabriel garcia marquez mr. mahfouz's style offers little that can be labeled egyptian
1	reminiscent of crime and punishment	its antihero said mahran is an egyptian raskolnikov who seeks nobility in robbing and killing
1	while the theme is compelling the plot and characters are not	we never care about said or the hypocrites he hunts
1	we never care about said or the hypocrites he hunts	the thief and the dogs is a pioneering work the first stream-of-consciousness novel in arabic but it is likely to disappoint western readers
1	mr. mahfouz has been pilloried and censored for questioning islam and advocating peace with israel	veiling his message has helped him endure
1	the shift won't affect operations	as part of its restructuring several years ago exxon moved most of those out of the city and sold its 53-floor rockefeller center skyscraper to a japanese company
1	it was beyond all expectations; what a coup	dallas its economy based on oil and real estate has been in a slump
1	it will cost less to run its headquarters at las colinas than in new york	the company won't say how much it will save but during at its interim location sources say it will likely pay rent of $10 to $15 per square foot.
1	the problem is intolerable for many people	i'm afraid of a popular revolt if this situation isn't corrected
1	but opposition legislators and others calling for help for south korea's renters say the proposed changes don't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary people to buy a home	some want lower limits on house sizes
1	but others large landowners real-estate developers and business leaders say the government's proposals are intolerable	the critics are lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties
1	it's ironic that david boren should be in the center of this mire	a former oklahoma governor he's a thoughtful defender of presidential powers in foreign policy
1	vandenberg and rayburn are heroes of mine	they allowed this country to be credible
1	it means a bipartisan majority	the sustainability of u.s. foreign policy is essential why was containment so successful?
1	mr. boren is confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions	that even grenada or the libyan raid would have taken place if consensus had been required
1	that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock	the lawyers are now in charge of our national security
1	hong kong financial institutions have been waiting for interest-rate futures for a long time	the contract was first proposed more than two years ago
1	despite the initial support expected trading in the contract is likely to start slowly	the wounds from the 1987 crash haven't yet healed and not all claims against the exchange clearinghouse -- by those who bet the hang seng index would fall -- have been settled
1	that there may be limits on how much the contract can grow because the hong kong dollar isn't a widely traded currency	the contract will be considered a success if it starts trading 500 to 1 000 lots a day
1	caution should . . . be the rule of the day	it would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general to say nothing of banks if prudence does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions
1	the u.s. futures exchanges compete world-wide as never before	today trading in almost any commodity can be diverted from u.s. markets with just a few strokes of a keyboard
1	today trading in almost any commodity can be diverted from u.s. markets with just a few strokes of a keyboard.	the u.s. exchanges need both market integrity and cost-efficiency; long-term growth depends on it
1	the u.s. exchanges need both market integrity and cost-efficiency	long-term growth depends on it
1	it is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation	in an already low-profitmargin business commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public depriving the private individual of access to the markets
1	faced with the virtually impossible task of supervising the execution of each trade many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with independents and instead hire their own salaried floor brokers	this would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers
1	voters still have very little idea what they can expect from him	after 25 years in city politics david dinkins remains an enigma
1	but i can assure you i will not	i am aware we have real budgetary problems
1	new york state comptroller edward regan predicts a $1.3 billion budget gap for the city's next fiscal year a gap that could grow if there is a recession	if elected mr. dinkins will probably have no choice but to raise taxes on overburdened businesses or cut spending in already under-serviced neighborhoods
1	he is going to face a mess	his supporters are not venal but their solution to everything will be to spend more money and he won't have any money
1	instead of focusing on the financial future mr. dinkins has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to 12 years of commotion generated by mayor koch	the thing about the dinkins candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of people
1	no doubt mr. dinkins has been a calming influence	he is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues' children opens doors for women and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody
1	but even in his front-runner campaign he has shown signs of the indecisiveness and confusion that some say has plagued his tenure as manhattan borough president -- and might hinder him as mayor	over the last few weeks he has frittered away roughly half of what was once a 33-point lead in the polls over mr. giuliani
1	everybody else had brought in the wagons and made their deal	he would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster
1	one board member bronx borough president ferdinand ferrer was said to be so impatient with mr. dinkins's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for mr. dinkins's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign	i had some problem from time to time on the length of time he would take to make up his mind
1	despite many doubts about his candidacy white new yorkers aren't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to mr. giuliani	the former u.s. attorney who prosecuted targets ranging from mafia dons to wall street executives has succeeded in raising questions about mr. dinkins's ethical standards but so far has failed to generate excitement about his own candidacy
1	the family's long absence is understandable	the family was in allied countries during both world war i and the long period of economic strife of the 1920s
1	ibm's visits to the debt market are closely watched by treasurers at other corporations and by credit market analysts	some analysts believe the company has the ability to pinpoint the trough in interest-rate cycles
1	we were oversold and today we bounced back	some accounts came in for some blocks in the secondary {market} which we haven't seen for a while
1	the market's tone improved after monday's pricing of $813 million new york city general obligation bonds	the issue's smooth absorption eased fears that supply would overwhelm demand in coming sessions
1	to suggest that a 10% drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted	that a mere 2% drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the dna structure
1	that a mere 2% drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the dna structure	even a small reduction is unacceptable and to suggest otherwise is penny-wise and pound-foolish
1	mr. melloan's column was right on the money but i wish it could have gone one step further	as an employee of a major refrigerator and freezer manufacturer i have been heavily involved in dealing with the political manifestations of the rowland-molina theory (named after the researchers who found in 1974 that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth's atmosphere) and the montreal protocol
1	that such measurements are a vital part of any intellectually honest evaluation of the threat posed by cfcs	while recognizing that professional environmentalists may feel threatened i intend to urge that uv-b be monitored whenever i can
1	although like all scientific theories it had its initial opponents few experts question the connection now	the discovery of the ozone hole over antarctica and the results of ground-based and high-altitude aircraft experiments conducted over the past several years serve as evidence that ozone depletion is related to cfc concentrations
1	that ltv may be trying to send a signal to major customers such as chrysler corp. and whirlpool corp. that steelmakers need more money	both companies are in the process of negotiating contracts with ltv and others
1	at first glance gold and utilities seem strange bedfellows	after all gold prices usually soar when inflation is high
1	but the two groups have something very important in common: they are both havens for scared money stocks for people who hate stocks	it's as if investors the past few days are betting that something is going to go wrong -- even if they don't know what
1	still a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares	the primary overriding thing is that people are frightened
1	that people are frightened	the aftershocks of oct. 13 (when the dow jones industrial average dropped 190 points) are still reverberating
1	britain's unsettled political scene also worries some investors	the gyrations in the british government add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a ragged stock market
1	utilities are a classic example	even in recessions people continue to use electric power water and gas at a fairly steady rate
1	mr. wachtel points to coca-cola co. and pepsico inc. as examples	they're selling for 18 to 22 times estimated 1990 per-share earnings
1	but the two groups represent a further step in defensiveness	if gold stocks and utilities continue to lead it may signal that the market is in for rough times
1	we are going to explode lower	anyone telling you to buy stocks in this market is technically irresponsible
1	robert stovall a veteran new york money manager and president of stovall/ twenty-first securities has money in both gold and utility issues	we could very well have {an economic} slowdown beginning very soon if not already
1	that you don't buy {gold stocks} based on powerful fundamentals	in addition to having high price-earnings ratios most pay puny dividends if any
1	it makes sense to have some money in both utilities and gold	my outlook is for a decline of about 10% in corporate profits in 1990
1	the buy programs came from very large institutional accounts that were also active in the stock-index futures markets	at one point almost all of the shares in the 20-stock major market index which mimics the industrial average were sharply higher
1	the market's surge also reflected an easing of concerns about volatility because of moves by a number of brokerage firms to curtail or cease stock-index arbitrage	much of the instability in stock prices lately has been blamed on arbitrage trading

1	both plans would drop child-care provisions from the house version of the deficit-reduction legislation and let it progress as a separate bill	while that could make it vulnerable to a veto by mr. bush that a presidential rejection would give their party a valuable issue in next year's congressional elections
1	yesterday mr. dole seemed weary of the bush administration's strategy of pushing the capital-gains measure at every chance in the face of democratic procedural hurdles	pushing the issue on legislation needed to avoid default by the federal government doesn't seem to be very good strategy to me
1	at 12:01 a.m. est today the federal government's temporary $2.87 trillion debt limit expired	to avoid default lawmakers must pass legislation raising the limit to $3.12 trillion from $2.80 trillion by next wednesday according to the treasury

1	sea containers plans to sell $1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50% of its common shares for $70 each	the company is trying to fend off a hostile bid by two european shipping firms
1	one would have thought this would have happened two or three years ago as the labor market tightened	it is a considerably delayed reaction
1	despite the big increases in health-care costs wages still account for a far greater share of overall labor costs	the overall private-sector employment cost index which includes both wages and benefits rose 4.7% in the 12 months ended in september compared with 4.5% for both the 12 months ended in june and the 12 months ended september 1988
1	that its real estate alone had a value of $4.5 billion	throw in its railroad minerals pipeline and oil assets and the chicago-based conglomerate should be worth 30 a share
1	the implied current net asset value of 22.70 {per share} is well below the 30 level that the street believed	the upside was in the intangible real estate . . . which is no longer an intangible
1	but it isn't clear why that should be so	the spinoff argument after all reverses the current notion that assets are worth more to private buyers than to public shareholders
1	business across the country is spending more time addressing this issue	it's a bottom-line issue
1	when sen. kennedy introduced a bill that would require employers to provide a minimum level of health insurance to workers but doesn't contain cost-control measures	partly in response a bipartisan group of senators from the finance and labor committees is drafting a plan to attract broader support
1	at 11.1% of gross national product u.s. health costs already are the highest in the world.	management and labor worry that the gap makes u.s. companies less competitive
1	that health costs add $700 to the price of each of its cars about $300 to $500 more per car than foreign competitors pay for health	the cost of health care is eroding standards of living and sapping industrial strength
1	capitalists who want to socialize the entire financing system for health	they hope they can buy some government cost discipline but this is a false hope
1	so far neither the bush administration nor congress is prepared to lead the way toward revamping health care	the administration lacks a comprehensive health-care policy.
1	but 1991 could be a window for action	the pressure for change will rise with costs
1	the pressure for change will rise with costs	employers are really going to be the ones to push for major change
1	the nam embraces efforts to measure the effectiveness of medical treatments and then to draft medical-practice guidelines	that such standards will improve treatment while limiting unnecessary tests and medical procedures
1	limiting care won't be easy or popular	to slow the rise in total spending it will be necessary to reduce per-capita use of services
1	to slow the rise in total spending it will be necessary to reduce per-capita use of services	this will require us to define -- and redefine -- what is `necessary' or `appropriate' care
1	this will require us to define -- and redefine -- what is `necessary' or `appropriate' care	this involves trade-offs and {it} cuts against the grain of existing consumer and even provider conceptions of what is `necessary
1	the consortium faced a setback in may when technical problems forced it to postpone the september launch until next spring	continued uncertainty about the timing of the consortium's debut could make it hard to find a #450 million cash injection
1	the estimated $1.8 billion for the space station would be double last year's level and total appropriations for the national aeronautics and space administration would grow 16% to nearly $12.4 billion	a string of costly projects including the high-speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite would continue to be developed within these limits

1	that his predicting continued volatility is just how the world is	if bringing the message is a crime i'm guilty of it
1	most revisions it will propose will be geared toward slowing down program trading during stressful periods	computers have made trading more rapid but that can be fixed with some fine-tuning
1	that big institutions have so much control over public investments that they can cause big swings in the market regardless of index arbitrage	a lot of people would like to go back to 1970 before program trading
1	japan's markets are more stable	if that continues a significant number of {u.s.} companies will go over there to raise money

1	it sure smells like it	30% of the loans he sampled were dead meat on the day they were made
1	that would be a formula for ensuring even more fha red ink	experience has shown that the most important element in predicting a housing-loan default is the down payment
1	because a purchaser can use an fha loan to finance all points and closing costs the fha can wind up lending more than a house is worth	if housing prices continue to fall many borrowers would be better off walking away from their homes and leaving taxpayers with the losses
1	exhibit a is last week's house vote to fund 40 pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that is at the heart of the hud scandal	none of the grants had been requested by hud judged competitively or were the subject of a single hearing

1	but increasing volatility in the sector has exhausted investors who try to follow its dips and swings	the stocks have been pummeled repeatedly by inventory gluts and disappointing earnings as the industry matures and slows
1	the otc technology sector is far from a cohesive unit	the group is divided primarily between software semiconductors and computers.

1	but it's risky	you don't want to lose the magic of the company's creative drive
1	but demands on the company's creativity are certain to grow	competition is intensifying as larger companies invade a mountain-bike market mr. sinyard's company once had virtually all to itself
1	one especially coveted specialized market the new players are targeting is mountain-bike accessories	accessories not only sell faster than whole bikes they also offer profit margins nearly double the 25% to 30% or so on sales of complete cycles
1	in response to the internationalization of the business mr. sinyard's company is replacing independent distributors overseas with wholly owned subsidiaries	the move will cut out the cost of a middleman and give specialized more control over marketing and sales
1	the seemingly mundane action has important implications for banks' recent entry into the underwriting of corporate securities	the fed's action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks' securities affiliates will be able to underwrite
1	over the past two years the fed has given a handful of banks' securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate asset-backed and municipal securities that had previously been the sole domain of securities firms	securities firms have challenged those fed approvals saying they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses
1	more importantly the volume of options written exceeded those purchased by almost 2-to-1	with such a lopsided book of options chemical was more vulnerable to erroneous valuation assumptions
1	ts valuation methodologies are recognized as some of the best on the street	not a lot was needed to be done

1	a slowing economy and its effect on corporate earnings is the foremost concern of many traders and analysts	unless the federal reserve eases interest rates soon to stimulate the economy profits could remain disappointing

1	it was just the culture of the industry that kept it from happening	the georgia-pacific offer has definitely changed the landscape
1	the georgia-pacific offer has definitely changed the landscape	it's much easier to be second
1	a georgia-pacific acquisition of nekoosa would create the largest u.s. forest-products company	based on 1988 sales georgia-pacific ranked third at $9.51 billion behind weyerhaeuser co. at $10 billion and international paper co. at $9.53 billion.

1	nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be	depending on how far down you go it may be difficult to pay off that debt
1	that even under those conditions the company still would realize a savings of tens of millions of dollars in the first year following a merger	the fit is so good we see this as a time of opportunity
1	in addition to the usual array of defenses including a so-called poison pill and a staggered board nekoosa has another takeover defense: a maine state law barring hostile bidders from merging acquired businesses for five years	nekoosa is incorporated in maine

1	carnival for example has already paid about $160 million of the total cost for fantasy	this may give it the right to seize the ship if the situation warrants it
1	the open-year accounting practice is widely recognized within lloyd's as of serious concern to the 31 329 member investors	the procedure causes great uncertainty because an investor can't be sure of his or her individual liability
1	california is narrowly limiting rather than expanding -- opportunities for negotiating sales	california regulators historically have misinterpreted their law
1	that in the past ibm has developed broad software strategies only for problems that crossed industry lines	ibm's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers' problems and wasn't just selling technology
1	ibm's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing	rather than just send out marketing people to knock on customers' doors ibm is making several hundred of its own manufacturing people available to discuss specific needs
1	well mankind can rest easier for now	though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the 26-year-old soviet to beat the pennsylvania-based computer he gave the machine a far worse drubbing than many expected
1	mr. kasparov was underwhelmed	the computer's mind is too straight too primitive lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top
1	this became apparent as game one a sicilian defense by mr. kasparov proceeded	no human can examine millions of moves but mr. kasparov using his ineffably powerful brain consistently found very good ones
1	by move 21 d.t. had fallen into a deep positional trap.	bishops usually are worth slightly more than knights but in this case mr. kasparov was left with a very dangerous knight and d.t.'s surviving bishop was reduced to passivity
1	he also launched a kingside storm sacrificing a pawn to denude d.t.'s king	no amount of weasling could have saved this game for d.t
1	no amount of weasling could have saved this game for d.t	a piece down the computer resigned
1	in a new position just after the opening a computer will have serious problems	in such positions you have to create something new and the computer isn't able to do that right now
1	after only 11 moves for each side the computer's position was shaky	greedily it grabbed a pawn at the cost of facing a brutal attack
1	mr. kasparov's continuation was slower but in the end just as deadly	he won d.t.'s queen for two minor pieces and two pawns -- not enough compensation in this position to give the computer much hope
1	cemetery officials hope the ads will not only draw visitors but bolster burials and endowment fund contributions	lake view had an operating deficit last year and has a poor reputation as an out-of-repair and crime-infested cemetery
1	the private non-profit cemetery has had trouble competing against its for-profit counterparts which use direct mail and other advertising to sell lots	we don't want to be known as ambulance chasers
1	mr. rockefeller buried beneath a 180-foot-tall granite obelisk didn't seem right for an ad either	the oil magnate who spent his later years passing out dimes to counter his penny-pinching image isn't terribly amusing

1	city officials feared widespread gridlock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed following last tuesday's earthquake	the massive temblor which killed at least 61 people severed the bay bridge a major artery to the east and closed most ramps leading to and from highway 101 the biggest artery to the south
1	many commuters who normally drove across the bay bridge actually may have reached work a bit faster on bart yesterday provided they could find a parking space at the system's jammed stations	in the best of times the bay bridge is the worst commute in the region often experiencing back-ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more
1	it looks like a holiday	a lot of people got scared and stayed home
1	the estimates of real gross national product prepared by the bureau of economic analysis in the department of commerce significantly understate the rate of economic growth	since the bureau's estimates for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratios calculated by the department of labor underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics
1	in an unrelated program in which the labor department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7% during the 1980s	even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector this labor department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real gnp estimates of 0.2 percentage point a year on average
1	that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least 1.5% a year between 1948 and 1988	because finance and services contribute 10% to final business product missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15% a year
1	here too mr. roberts is way off the mark	the reality is that bank loans have been linked to policy improvements for 40 years
1	support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the bank's	over the years it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the third world through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the international finance corp
1	this is an impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry	entrepreneurs don't rush to get into a stagnant or declining industry
1	total magazine ad revenue for the same period increased 12% to $4.6 billion	though for some magazines categories a tough advertising climate persists the industry in general is doing well compared with the newspaper industry
1	and lang communications has announced ms. magazine after 17 years will no longer carry advertising as of january	lang is cutting costs and will attempt to operate the magazine with only subscription revenue
1	the introduction of a 3% consumption tax in april has helped sales	the new tax though a source of general resentment among japanese taxpayers replaced a higher commodities tax that applied to automobiles
1	it is offering to purchase the $154.2 million amount of its 12 3/4% senior notes due june 15 1991 at par plus accrued interest to the dec. 8 purchase date	the offer is required under the senior note indenture as a result of control data's recent sale of its disk drive subsidiary imprimis to seagate technology inc
1	some producers of polyethylene figuring the inventory reductions are near an end have announced price boosts	the first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks when the new prices become effective
1	it is close to being a record undersubscription	fund managers don't like to have rights issues that don't have an obvious reason
1	but except for the embarrassment british air will emerge relatively unscathed from the flopped issue	underwriters led by lazard brothers & co. will pick up the rest of the airline's offer of four convertible capital bonds for every nine common shares
1	and instead of buying the ual stake the u.k. carrier will be able to reduce its high debt level and build an acquisition war chest	from a cash flow point of view british airways is better off not being in united airlines in the short term
1	the stories are rubbish	there is no difference of opinion between (chairman) lord king and sir colin on any aspect of company policy
1	net income was 17 cents a share in the third quarter compared with 16 cents a share a year earlier	rainbow's stock dropped 2 to 14 1/4
1	investors will favor companies that historically have posted annual earnings growth of 15% to 20%	that would be good news for the otc market because many small growth stocks are traded there
1	higher earnings helped some issues	amgen rose 2 1/4 to 54 3/4 on almost 800 000 shares and cvb financial jumped 4 to 41 on only 1 000 shares
1	setting the stage for a possible bidding war with gm	jaguar has been discussing an alliance with gm but ford's move may derail the talks
1	and most of these are absolutely unnecessary	just about all of them could have been avoided
1	corporate managers who want to start their own business are the highest failure risks	they know all the answers and are not used to working more than 40 hours a week
1	the blue-collar worker who decides to start a business will listen and take advice	his humility gives him a much better chance of success
1	avoiding failure is easy	it's unfortunate so many must learn the hard way
1	the recent decline in copper stocks was misleading in the face of a slowdown in manufacturing	traders could have picked up signals of an imminent price decline had they been watching the scrap metal markets which became noticeably weaker two to three weeks ago
1	that the preliminary estimate of the third-quarter gross national product is due out tomorrow and is expected to be up about 2.5% to 3%	if the number is a little better then copper will respond positively if it is worse then more selling could ensue
1	according to mr. threlkeld the bottleneck in copper production isn't at the mines but at the copper refineries	it takes three months to turn copper concentrate into cathodes
1	yesterday's price action reflected weakness in the stock market and the dollar	gold still acts as a haven when uncertainty prevails in the financial markets as it did yesterday
1	if further experiments are successful the work would represent a major advance in research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome	the drug azt the only treatment currently on the market claims only to help stop the spread of aids not to cure it
1	they hoped to conduct tests on human patients in the u.s. by late next year	japan doesn't have enough aids patients to do significant experimentation in that country
1	i'm not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods	some infected cells may not have the relevant antigen and so wouldn't be killed even after exposure to the antibody
1	inflation is under control	with economic growth slowing they believe the fed should ease credit even further
1	indeed skepticism was amply captured by a joke told by poles at the conference: the world must be coming to an end	the russians are talking peace the palestinians are talking elections and the poles are engaged in commerce
1	even least-cost environmental solutions will require billions of dollars	new types of financing must make funds available without draining poland's hard-currency reserves
1	east bloc pollution data typically have been state secrets	while polish data have been freely available since 1980 it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information
1	it was like driving down the highway watching a wreck	everybody was rubber-necking
1	some analysts at least are buying that argument and weren't alarmed by the losses	what really matters is the operating income of the divisions
1	but so far there's little evidence the new urgency is trickling down to the managers who actually do hiring	is there really a commitment or an illusion of activity
1	fear of aids hinders hiring at few hospitals	dedication runs high
1	and somebody loses on the expected repeal of section 89 the benefits test fought by most employers	software producers had each invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in programs that now have no use
1	why can't we teach our children to read write and reckon	it's not that we don't know how to because we do
1	the whole notion of creativity in education was (and is) part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction which was (and is) regarded as authoritarian a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful if as yet undefined potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children	it is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive
1	fortunately these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood and they have enough common sense to know what that demands	their commitment to creativity cannot survive adolescent illiteracy
1	but it is unfair to dump on teachers as distinct from the educational establishment	and on the whole they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching
1	but our education proceeded at the hands of those others who were merely competent and conscientious	in this sense a teacher can be compared to one's family doctor
1	in this sense a teacher can be compared to one's family doctor	if he were brilliant he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place
1	our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis	whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity; it is not an educational problem
1	if we wish to be serious about american education we know exactly what to do -- and just as important what not to do	there are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation some of them in the poorest of ghettos and they are all sending us the same message
1	conversely there are the majority of unsuccessful schools and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand	we really do know all we need to know if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking
1	in this respect it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute rather than eloquently concerned	they are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap
1	a comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need	what gov. clinton is advocating in effect is extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years
1	parental involvement is a bad idea	parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children
1	locally elected school boards especially in our larger cities become the prey of ambitious generally corrupt and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians	new york is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance
1	the new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers	there is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures (in real terms) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century educational performance has declined
1	there is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures (in real terms) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century educational performance has declined	that is the way the system works
1	the notion that tracking is somehow undemocratic is absurd	the purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential
1	it is generally desirable to use older textbooks -- many of them alas out of print -- rather than newer ones	the latter are modish trendy often downright silly and at best insubstantial
1	most important of all schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty the curriculum and all matters of student discipline	study after study -- the most recent from the brookings institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head
1	yields on five-year cds at major banks were averaging about 7.45% and 10-year treasury notes were paying less than 8%	the cd seemed like a great deal
1	more important the cd was purchased on the secondary or resale market	because the cd had an effective yield of 13.4% when it was issued in 1984 and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then part of the price dr. blumenfeld paid was a premium
1	dr. blumenfeld isn't unique	especially at times like these when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect too many people chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk
1	it's not a blanket commitment it's a case-by-case situation	there's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware of the risks
1	you always have to watch out for yourself	no one else will watch out for you
1	sci tv's grace period for paying its bills is due to expire nov. 16	it now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt
1	as for junk-holders they're discovering it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by kkr	the bonds of sci tv now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about 60 cents on the dollar according to r.d. smith & co. in new york which trades distressed securities
1	but some militant sci tv junk-holders say that's not enough	they contend that sci tv's equity now is worthless
1	the pilots are working under an expired contract and the machinists contract expires next month	that gives them enormous leverage including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt they oppose
1	that many arbitrage firms are afraid to sell their ual stock at the bottom but already own so much they can't buy any more	this deal is like a roach motel
1	this deal is like a roach motel	they check in but they can't check out
1	the pilots might end up teaming up with their longtime adversaries the machinists union in a recapitalization	the machinists are reviewing proposals they made in the past for recapitalizations that would pay a special shareholder dividend and give employees a minority stake
1	the agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in china	the agency won't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any chinese plant to enter the u.s. until satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in china to prevent bacterial contamination
1	the outbreaks were traced to staphylococcus aureus a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables	a recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in early march
1	that the beijing government has taken many effective measures to stop the mushroom contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes	the problem will be solved very soon
1	when the fertilized cells divide to eight cells a single cell from each embryo can be tested for genetic defects	a healthy embryo can be picked for implantation and defective ones discarded
1	they've now adapted the yeast to making genetically engineered drugs	like the bacteria used by genetic engineers the yeast can take in human genes and churn out human proteins for medical use
1	the oil company claims its yeast system also is better than bacteria at high-volume production of genetically engineered drugs	chiron corp. an emeryville calif. biotechnology firm is seeing if the phillips yeast can be used to make its genetically engineered human proteins
1	in the bell labs experiments an mri-type of machine synchronized with the heartbeat via an electrocardiogram rapidly flashes a magnetic field on and off as blood passes a certain point in a vessel	the rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the blood give a stop-motion movie of the blood-filled vessel (like the stop-motion seen in disco dancers when a strobe light is flashing)
1	international investigators urged britain to allow prosecution of suspected nazi war criminals who took refuge there after 1945	under current law such suspects are immune from prosecution for acts committed while not british citizens
1	china had refused to repatriate citizens who sneaked into hong kong illegally since early this month when the colony allowed a dissident chinese swimmer to flee to the u.s	about 1 100 chinese were awaiting repatriation yesterday
1	but the shift has also been fueled by necessity	while premium-brand spirits like smirnoff vodka and jack daniel's whiskey are riding high in the u.s. domestic spirits consumption fell 15% to 141.1 million cases in 1988 from 166 million cases in 1979
1	when it lowered its tax on imported spirits and levied a tax on many domestic products	california wineries benefiting from lowered trade barriers and federal marketing subsidies are expanding aggressively into japan as well as canada and great britain
1	the biggest foreign inroads though have been made by bourbon	while u.s. makers of vodka rum and other spirits compete against powerhouses abroad trade agreements prohibit any other country from making bourbon
1	bourbon makes up just 1% of world-wide spirits consumption but it represented 57% of u.s. liquor exports last year according to jobson; no other category had more than 19%	big u.s. distillers are fiercely vying for this market which grew to $77 million last year from $33 million in 1987 according to government figures
1	guinness's schenley industries unit has increased its tv advertising in japan and has built partnerships with duty-free shops throughout asia enabling it to install prominent counter displays	the company's i.w. harper brand is the leading bourbon in japan with 40% of the market
1	third-quarter and nine-month results don't include any provision for premium returns that could be ordered by the california department of insurance under proposition 103	it has applied for an exemption from these rate rollbacks and plans to defend its filing in hearings before the department
1	to support his rejection of a peace plan approved sunday by lebanon's legislature	the plan lacked a withdrawal timetable
1	the firm is meeting resistance from some big states including new jersey new york california pennsylvania connecticut and missouri	they don't want to simply accept the settlements offered by drexel
1	that total would be important for drexel	the investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry.
1	ramada's stock rose 87.5 cents on the news to close at $11.25 in composite new york stock exchange trading	the announcement dispelled some wall street observers' fears that new world might demand a huge premium for the delay or scrap the deal entirely
1	but with its stake in jaguar which it raised yesterday to 11.95% ford could convene a special jaguar shareholders' meeting and urge holders to vote to drop the restriction sooner	a successful vote would put pressure on the british government to lift the restriction
1	jaguar seems to be losing interest in giving gm a minority stake it wouldn't surprise me if {jaguar executives} want to wait and see what the color of that {ford bid} is first	ford officials will meet with jaguar executives in the next week to outline their proposed offer
1	he predicted ford officials will meet with jaguar executives in the next week to outline their proposed offer	sir john egan jaguar's chairman so far has refused to meet with ford officials but he is believed to be willing to consider a specific bid proposal
1	as for gm its fallback position has to be a full bid itself	a ford takeover of jaguar would have such implications for the balance of power in the 1990s that general motors can't afford to step aside
1	a ford takeover of jaguar would have such implications for the balance of power in the 1990s that general motors can't afford to step aside	they will have to throw their hat in the ring
1	gm's interest in jaguar reflects a desire to help diversify the u.s. company's products in the growing luxury-car segment of the market	its opel line has a solid image and a recent string of highly successful new models but it lacks jaguar's cachet
1	october 13th left us with a cut and exposed nerve	people are fearful and sensitive
1	people are fearful and sensitive	everybody's finger is one inch closer to the button
1	for many it began to look like a replay of oct. 13	as stocks and stock-index futures fell a trading limit was hit in the s&p 500 stock futures pit
1	as stocks and stock-index futures fell a trading limit was hit in the s&p 500 stock futures pit	under a post-1987 crash reform the chicago mercantile exchange wouldn't permit the december s&p futures to fall further than 12 points for a half hour
1	a ual statement after the market closed monday indicated that the airline's board wanted to keep the company independent effectively crushing hopes of an immediate buy-out	five minutes before the big board opened a preliminary price was flashed for ual -- somewhere between 135 and 155 a loss of as much as $43 a share from monday's close
1	at 10:33 when the s&p 500 december futures contract crunched to a 12-point loss under the force of sell programs s&p futures trading was halted and program trades on the big board were routed into a special computer that scans for order imbalances	under the rules adopted by the chicago mercantile exchange the futures contract cannot drop below the limit but buyers can purchase futures
1	almost simultaneously painewebber began a very visible buy program for dozens of stocks	the combined buying rallied the dow into a small gain before closing at a slight loss
1	goodyear tire & rubber tumbled 2 7/8 to 43 7/8	its third-quarter earnings were higher than a year ago but fell short of expectations

1	in one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date -- involving products with an annual value of $135 billion in the u.s. alone -- the signatories agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs	world-wide production would be cut in half by 1998
1	that's a lot of banishment as it turns out	cfcs are the primary ingredient in a gas often referred to by the du pont trade name freon which is compressed to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment
1	but even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $100 billion between now and the year 2000 to convert to other coolants foaming agents and solvents and to redesign equipment for these less efficient substitutes the montreal protocol's legions of supporters say it is worth it	that cfcs are damaging the earth's stratospheric ozone layer which screens out some of the sun's ultraviolet rays
1	but does it have to be so soon	that even if cfcs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10% by the middle of the next century
1	it is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without cfcs	there is after all big money in environmentalism
1	maybe we should ask why it was that du pont so quickly capitulated and issued a statement giving it wide publicity that it was withdrawing cfcs	freon introduced in 1930 revolutionized america by making refrigeration and air conditioning practical after all
1	university professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for alternative energy	they needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts
1	in other words environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few	that tends to tilt the public debate toward solutions even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency
1	that tends to tilt the public debate toward solutions even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency	there is an element of make-work involved
1	while franchisees were having a tough time holding sales mcdonald's company-operated stores posted hefty gains for the nine months with sales per company-operated unit rising $20 000	that the company often has better store locations than do its franchisees thus aiding promotional efforts
1	the divergence between the stock and bond markets is a sign of growing unease about the economic outlook	a sinking economy depresses corporate earnings and thus stock prices but it buoys bond prices as interest rates fall
1	that unease is expected to grow today when the government reports on september durable goods orders and again thursday when the first assessment of third-quarter economic growth is released	durable goods orders fell about 1% compared with a 3.9% gain in august and that growth in the third quarter slowed to about 2.3% from the second quarter's 2.5
1	meanwhile competitors are being spawned almost daily; some 300 new businesses -- many just one-person shops -- have sprung up	the industry's total revenues approach $200 million
1	the industry's total revenues approach $200 million	in any high-stakes case that one side or the other -- or even both -- is using litigation consultants
1	despite their ubiquity the consultants aren't entirely welcome	the social scientists' vision of the american jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen
1	in the film classic twelve angry men the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict	after hours of conflict and debate that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity
1	after hours of conflict and debate that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity	in real life jurors may not always work that way but some court observers question why they shouldn't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to
1	but the effort is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things rationally	i find it troubling
1	that the consultants' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services	the affluent people and the corporations can buy it the poor radicals {in political cases} get it free and everybody in between is at a disadvantage and that's not the kind of system we want
1	the defense also learned that college-educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the vietnam war	a more blue-collar panel became a second aim
1	the problem for ibm trial lawyers thomas barr and david boies was how to make such a highly technical case understandable	as the trial progressed they were eager to know if the jury was keeping up with them
1	the hardest thing in any complex case is to retain objectivity and in some sense your ignorance	what you look for in a shadow jury is very much what you do when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it
1	when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it	a shadow jury is a way to do that in a more systematic and organized way
1	forecasting is only one part of litigation sciences' work	changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters
1	litigation sciences doesn't make moral distinctions	if a client needs prejudiced jurors the firm will help find them
1	if a client needs prejudiced jurors the firm will help find them	we don't control the facts.
1	but any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy to employ	in our system of advocacy the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can
1	in one personal-injury case a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool but the fall didn't explain why one of her arms was discolored bluish	by repeatedly drawing the jury's attention to the arm the defense lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman's injuries
1	the ploy worked	the defense won
1	slick graphics pre-tested for effectiveness also play a major role in litigation sciences' operation	that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it visually
1	computer-generated videos help	the average american watches seven hours of tv a day
1	the average american watches seven hours of tv a day	they are very visually sophisticated
1	litigation consulting isn't a guarantee of a favorable outcome	that in one in 20 cases it was flatout wrong in its predictions
1	but the last thing you want to do is manipulate the subconscious to make them think better	what you then do is you make them think inappropriately
1	mr. etzioni also suggests forbidding anyone from gathering background information about the jurors	some courts release names and addresses and researchers can drive by houses look up credit ratings and even question neighbors
1	mr. boies the first lawyer to use mr. vinson's services cautions against courts' allowing extensive jury questioning (known as voir dire) or giving out personal information about the jurors	the more extensive the voir dire the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective
1	we believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your thorough consideration before making this key rtc appointment	the rtc needs the most able competent management available
1	the quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales didn't rebound in september from the summer doldrums as they usually do	he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $5.70 a share from his previous estimate of $6.10
1	he will make another cut to about $5.50 a share in light of the third-quarter report	eaton's quarter profit margin on controls was lower than he anticipated
1	and it is important that olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product	that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market
1	depending on the type of software and peripherals used the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals (a role usually filled by a minicomputer) as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer	it's the missing link in olivetti's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers
1	it turned out to be lucky for us	if the whole market thinks what you're doing is crazy you don't have much competition
1	on tuesday trelleborg's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions -- minerals processing and building and distribution -- as separately quoted companies on stockholm's stock exchange	at current market prices the twin public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated 2.5 billion swedish kronor ($386 million) to trelleborg's coffers analysts say
1	most of the new additions were barely profitable if not outright loss makers	applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker ab electrolux mr. andersson and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood -- and got quick results
1	help may be on the way	the antitrust division of the justice department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools
1	the antitrust division of the justice department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools	fear of the price police could help cool things off in the 1990s
1	that a good college will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true won't do anymore	forget about treasury bills or a money-market fund
1	still it's no bad thing if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more	the situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they'll be able to do it out of current income
1	the situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they'll be able to do it out of current income	that's crazy
1	half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal	that way parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time comes to pay tuition
1	but richard anderson head of the forum for college financing alternatives at columbia university a research group partly financed by the federal government says zeros are particularly ill-suited	their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up
1	their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up	that won't matter if they are held to maturity but if for any reason the parents need to sell them before then there could be a severe loss of principal
1	the issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee	prepayments much like mutual-fund purchases are pooled for investment
1	and they're leaning more toward fixed income whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases	i'm not sure they're going to make it work
1	when it comes to investing trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded	investors don't know the actual returns that securities will deliver or the ups and downs that will occur along the way
1	unknown to mr. tharp he had fouled his net on a special irs project to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes	confronted with the evidence mr. tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined $5 000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison
1	once such abuses become so pervasive the irs builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and doesn't need special projects for them	san franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula not because irs agents envy their life styles
1	the number of misclassified workers may be in the millions mostly paid by small firms	many workers especially professionals want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees can't
1	but a medical clinic with about 20 employees wrongly listed all of them -- including physicians and receptionists -- as independent contractors	the irs assessed the clinic $350 000 in back payroll taxes
1	in the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding $500 000 who were filing nonresident returns it squeezed $7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a florida resident	we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project
1	october is a critical month for the privatization program	manila is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged
1	that the more valuable the asset the harder the privatization process	you just don't see a whole lot happening
1	to be sure the program hasn't completely stalled	the asset privatization trust the agency chiefly responsible for selling government-held properties has recorded sales of more than $500 million since it began functioning in december 1986
1	what he calls temporary setbacks	in light of the poor results recently the agency is adopting an attitude of flexibility
1	when the trust failed to sell a state-owned commercial bank associated bank for the minimum price of 671 million pesos ($31 million	at the end of the month the agency again will offer the bank
1	that the government may have difficulty selling the institution even without a floor price	the bank has a negative net worth
1	but according to bankers and stock analysts who have studied the paper mill price isn't the only consideration	as it stands now the government would continue to hold 45% of picop after the 36% stake is sold
1	beta is only part of the risk in a stock	there is risk that is not associated with market moves and the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of that
1	the deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation	carriers could use their equipment more efficiently
1	carriers could use their equipment more efficiently leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill	shippers cut about $35 billion from their annual inter-city truck and rail costs to about $150 billion or about 6.4% of gross national product down from 8% of gnp in 1981
1	shippers are saying `the party's over	shippers won't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years
1	shippers won't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years	transport rates won't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy
1	we've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions	now we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as carriers replace equipment pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor
1	less-than-truckload companies discounted away a 4.7% rate increase implemented last april	the carriers were competing fiercely for market share
1	rate discounting in that industry has begun to stabilize	consolidated freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3% late this year or early next year and at least two competitors have announced similar increases
1	import competition for u.s. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing working-girl mink and similar lower-priced imported furs in recent years	merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher-priced furriers
1	merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher-priced furriers: the younger woman -- even in her late 20s -- who never thought she could buy a mink	the new market helped boost u.s. fur sales to about $1.8 billion a year now triple the level in the late 1970s
1	many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made	these imports haven't squeezed them
1	but low-priced and middle-priced furriers like mr. purnick say imports have cut their sales	a woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a u.s.-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than $2 000
1	early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their american counterparts and were more open to innovation	in 1982 he started a factory in greece
1	he also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur and he decided to follow suit	by combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad he says he has been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost
1	and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the midwest	small retailers who can't afford to travel to his new york showroom have become fair game
1	and those who didn't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages	the intensive labor needed to manufacture furs {in the u.s.} is not as available as it was
1	you can't make a commodity out of a luxury	that chasing consumers with low-priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs
1	whatever people want to buy i'll sell	the name of the game is to move goods
1	those enterprises however are not going to be privatized	they are officially considered strategic and their privatization is prohibited by the mexican constitution
1	a long succession of mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to without having to answer to the public	to guarantee that mexicana de aviacion and other companies will really be privatized mexico needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability
1	toward a possible recession	in addition to softer production data weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence some analysts believe the two recent natural disasters -- hurricane hugo and the san francisco earthquake -- will carry economic ramifications in the fourth quarter
1	until the money market fund was created in the 1970s	by 1980 there were more than 100 such funds
1	keeping the listed price at a dollar is primarily a convenience	actually the funds do fluctuate but beyond the third decimal place
1	and reduce the deficit	repeal would generate more in new taxes than the government would lose in increased social security benefit payments
1	that it boosted its stake in a.p. green to 8.7%	it now holds 233 000 a.p. green common shares
1	rorer in july had projected lower third-quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of 1989	the company is still looking for a strong fourth quarter in all areas -- sales operating income and net income
1	whose sales and market share in the u.s. had slipped in the first half of 1989	rorer opted to sell asilone and thrombinar to raise revenue that would kick start its increased marketing efforts behind maalox
1	he said rorer opted to sell asilone and thrombinar to raise revenue that would kick start its increased marketing efforts behind maalox	we had underfunded maalox for a year
1	medical-supply houses are expected to report earnings increases of about 15% on average for the third quarter despite sales increases of less than 10%	to offset sluggish sales growth companies have been cutting staff mostly through attrition and slowing the growth in research and development spending
1	he has not made that intellectual leap	we were wrong
1	bob stone stewed over a letter from his manager putting him on probation for insubordination	mr. stone thought the discipline was unfair
1	the discipline was unfair	that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons
1	mr. stone thought the discipline was unfair; he believed that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons	unable to persuade the manager to change his decision he went to a company court for a hearing
1	alter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at federal express in memphis the defense and underseas systems divisions of honeywell in minneapolis a general electric plant in columbia md. or a number of other companies	these firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world: the rise of what i call corporate due process
1	it increases employee commitment to the company with all that means for efficiency and quality control	what must your management team do to establish corporate due process
1	make sure you have a strong personnel department	it must be able to handle most of the complaints that cannot be solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated with cases
1	make your due-process system visible	it won't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it
1	sterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in mr. lawson's promise friday	in european trading it declined to $1.5890 and 2.9495 marks from $1.5940 and 2.9429 marks late thursday
1	one option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling-off period	although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid ual chairman stephen wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort at least temporarily and to return to running the company full time
1	in a speech prepared for delivery to london's financial community mr. lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the british economy using high interest rates as the essential instrument to carry out the campaign	that rates will have to remain high for some time to come
1	that he would be watching exchange rates carefully	a sinking pound makes imports more expensive
1	mr. lawson's speech came on the heels of a grueling period for the u.k. economy	two weeks ago in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound he raised base rates a full percentage point to 15%
1	once you make up your mind about an investment the rest is easy right	you just call your broker and say buy or sell
1	dream on	there are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you don't know what you're doing
1	with a market order an investor tells a broker to buy or sell at the market	it's like saying get me in now or get me out now
1	suppose an investor wants to sell a stock but not for less than $55	a limit order to sell could be entered at that price
1	stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level	once the price reaches that level a stop order turns into a market order and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get
1	unlike stop orders stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price	if it can't be made at that price it doesn't get filled
1	he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options	i like to use them to feel out the market
1	this is really two orders in one generally for the same security or commodity instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order	in a fast-moving market it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security
1	on oct. 19 1987 some investors learned the consequences of entering good-til-canceled limit orders and then forgetting about them	they found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel
1	it is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed	investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are usually stuck with the consequences
1	i was appalled to read the misstatements of facts in your oct. 13 editorial colombia's brave publisher	it is the right-wing guerrillas who are aligned with the drug traffickers not the left wing
1	it was the second anniversary of the 1987 crash but this time it was different	stocks rallied on good earnings reports and on data that showed less inflation than expected
1	blue chips led the march up in heavy trading	the dow jones industrial average rose 39.55 points to 2683.20
1	one floor trader noted in astonishment that nobody seemed to mind the news that british airways isn't making a special effort to revive the ual buy-out	the announcement of the buy-out's troubles triggered the market's nose dive a week ago
1	when an investor group disclosed yesterday that it had obtained all the financing required to complete its $1.6 billion leveraged buy-out of american medical international	that's put some oomph back into this market
1	it's traders squaring positions	it's not good
1	consumer stocks once again set the pace for blue-chip issues	philip morris added 1 1/8 to 44 1/2 in big board composite trading of 3.7 million shares coca-cola co. gained 2 3/8 to 70 3/8 merck gained 1 3/8 to 77 3/8 and american telephone & telegraph advanced 7/8 to 43 3/8 on 2.5 million shares
1	capital cities-abc surged 42 5/8 to 560	kidder peabody raised its investment rating on the stock and its earnings estimates for 1989 and 1990 based on optimism that the company's abc television network will continue to fare well in the ratings
1	dun & bradstreet lost 1 7/8 to 51 7/8 on 1.8 million shares	merrill lynch lowered its short-term rating on the stock and its estimate of 1990 earnings
1	b.a.t industries the most active amex issue rose 3/8 to 12 3/8	the company received shareholder approval for its restructuring plan designed to fend off a hostile takeover bid from a group headed by financier sir james goldsmith
1	the environmental protection agency is getting a lot out of the superfund program	of the $4.4 billion spent so far on the program 60% is going for administrative costs management and research
1	at current allocations that means epa will be spending $300 billion on itself	it may not be toxic but we know where one waste dump is
1	he told me to choose an area where just by being mediocre i could be great	he tried management consulting traded in turquoise for a while and even managed professional wrestlers
1	but in this case the needle has a very sharp point	though it's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent the fact remains that as one wag puts it anybody who can fog a mirror can call himself a financial planner
1	but in effect they operate in the dark	there is no effective regulation of planners no accepted standard for admission into their ranks no way to assess their performance no way even to know how many of them there are
1	so it should come as no shock that the profession if that's what it is has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients' money	alarmed state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners
1	industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards too	they're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine
1	the danger to investors from incompetence is humongous far greater than that from crookery	his group like others wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners
1	the best planner might be no planner at all	for most investors the benefits just aren't worth the risks
1	but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it	her group used to give tips on selecting planners -- check educational and experience credentials consult regulators and better business bureaus -- but found that even some people who took these steps were still getting ripped off
1	even the minority of them who must register with the securities and exchange commission as investment advisers have been enough to swamp the agency's capacity	the sec has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in 1980 -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15 000 over the past decade
1	the sec has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in 1980 -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15 000 over the past decade	currently a registered investment adviser can expect an sec audit only once every 12 years
1	a lot of bad things can happen in 12 years	it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem
1	the most common conflict involves compensation	that nearly 90% of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities insurance and other financial products they recommend
1	that nearly 90% of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities insurance and other financial products they recommend	the issue: is the planner putting his clients into the best investments or the ones that garner the biggest commissions
1	in 1986 the new york attorney general's office got an order from a state court in albany shutting down first meridian corp. an albany financial-planning firm that had invested $55 million on behalf of nearly 1 000 investors	in its notice of action the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into balanced investment portfolios; instead the attorney general alleged the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings coins and florida condos
1	the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings coins and florida condos	those investments paid big commissions to first meridian payments investors were never told about
1	and first meridian's president roger v. sala portrayed himself as a financial expert when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma work as a real-estate and insurance salesman and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth	first meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general
1	two such actions could be particularly embarrassing to the industry	both name j. chandler peterson an atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the iafp as defendant
1	wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots he opened up his briefcase and dumped $1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors	he wanted to show the color of his money
1	he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs	the suit is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people
1	in many scams or alleged scams involving planners it's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm's way	using it wouldn't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner
1	certificates of deposit don't pay 23% a year for example but that didn't give pause to clients of one alabama planner	now they're losers and he's in jail in mobile county
1	never mind	you already know the answer
1	meanwhile in the squat office buildings that ring fashion island the odds are good that someone is getting fleeced	that at any given time a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here
1	that at any given time a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here	they seem to like these industrial parks
1	you don't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in green bay or buffalo	con men hate snow
1	newport beach fits the scam artists' specifications perfectly	what more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for
1	there were some business deals that went bad mr. jones says but no intent to defraud	newport beach operations differ from the hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars
1	someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government	not only does this come close to a violation of law it violates the trust we have all worked to develop
1	it's time to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future	i've invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee
1	the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation	last week central intelligence agency director william webster publicly called on congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the u.s. more freedom to act in coups
1	nevertheless the administration's criticisms appeared to have made some headway with sens.	the three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines without changing the basic assassination ban to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered u.s. encouragement of coups against anti-american leaders
1	one of the best deals though may mean skipping christmas dinner with the relatives	this week many carriers are announcing cut-rate fares designed to get people to fly on some of the most hallowed -- and slowest -- days of the year including christmas
1	they are cutting ticket prices by as much as 70% from normal levels for travel to most u.s. locations on dec. 24 25 29 30 and 31 and jan. 4 5 and 6	the promotions put round-trip fares at $98 $148 and $198
1	there's even a special fare for clergy that doesn't require the usual stay over saturday night	that way they can be home in time for work sunday
1	but that doesn't mean half of the students attending berkeley will be admitted this way	the plan is talking about applicants admitted not students who enroll
1	the meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research	of the 1 300 chemists registered for the society's weeklong meeting fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week's end
1	the heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in	because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation they asserted that the excess heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod
1	his experiment was very erratic	it would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times it would begin producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down
1	the bursts often occur after they perturbed the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied or switching the current off and on	that some anomalous chemical reactions might be producing the heat
1	in subsequent experiments one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time	they concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment
1	throughout the 1980s investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning	capital has been democratized and people want in
1	my revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion	like all americans seeking chronic prosperity i do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools if only to assuage my father-in-law who believes in such things
1	by 1987 these properties were in a tailspin causing my broker at pru-bache to remark that she'd never seen anything like it	concerned for her state of mind i dropped them -- and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health
1	we've all got money to spend some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it	bank it
1	so go out there and eat that debt	you're right there in the mainstream of american business building value on the back of insupportable expenditures
1	but further major advances on the nikkei aren't foreseen this week by market observers	investors are still waiting to see how the u.s. government will decide on interest rates and how the dollar will be stabilized
1	british airways rose initially after announcing its withdrawal from the ual deal	they viewed the initial #390-million ($622 million) outlay for a 15% stake in the airline as a bit much
1	maybe i'm a little stuffy but i wouldn't sell them	who knows how much they'll be worth 100 years from now
1	i would say he's definitely not in need of money	he has good investments
1	i assume those accounts are closed	he'd want to give out his current account numbers
1	analysts hailed the sweetened pension package	this tells you at&t is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure
1	and a lot more will be done	improving profitability of u.s. operations is an extremely high priority in the company
1	the scope of the improvement in the u.s. business caught some analysts by surprise	the company's domestic business has performed poorly for years
1	that against the backdrop of a nearly 40-point rise in the dow jones industrial average that shouldn't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength	some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead
1	i think the next few quarters will be difficult	margins will remain under pressure and when the new mainframe does ship i'm not sure it will be a big winner
1	margins will remain under pressure and when the new mainframe does ship i'm not sure it will be a big winner	he was revising his estimate for dec's current year from $8.20 a share to well below $8 although he hasn't settled on a final number
1	that gain probably translated into about 5% to 7% in dollar terms well below recent quarters' gains of above 20%	that was a disappointment and a sign of overall computer-market softness in europe
1	marc schulman with ubs securities in new york dropped his estimate of dec's full-year net to $6.80 a share from $8	although overall revenues were stronger dec drew down its european backlog and had flat world-wide orders overall
1	besides term life and whole life (the old standbys) we now have universal life universal variable life flexible adjustable universal life policies with persistency bonuses policies festooned with exotic riders living benefit policies and on and on	what to do
1	it may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal	if you flunk you may not be able to buy it
1	amex said it would charge me $576 a year for $100 000 of coverage -- and would pay me back all the premiums i put in if i canceled the policy after 10 years	sounds great -- or does it
1	third and most important amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount	i'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that i'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile
1	i'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that i'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile	that would be all right with amex which could then lock in its investment profit but it doesn't add up to a smart money move for me
1	this is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance the kind that amasses cash value	the word death cannot be escaped entirely by the industry but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms preferring to talk about savings and investment instead
1	but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms preferring to talk about savings and investment instead	the implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of cd or mutual-fund account with an added feature
1	that is gilding the lily	the fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into
1	that's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package	again no free lunch
1	one newer wrinkle has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons	the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy loans and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment
1	i'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately so i look into the broad category called universal life	it is far more flexible than straight whole life
1	at a back-yard barbecue for example a friend boasts that she'll only have to pay premiums on her john hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be guaranteed	i call her agent david dominici
1	insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise don't use commissioned salesmen	there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial setup charges -- but i figure that the lack of commission and of surrender fees for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot
1	i'm thinking about using the $871 annual premium to finance a trip to paris first	a person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there -- and shop for something more exciting while she's doing it
1	in east germany where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism they're not laughing about their new leader egon krenz	mr. krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him
1	it was quite a shock	for the first time in my life i wasn't sure whether i was listening to our news or west german television
1	and that's a problem	mr. krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor mr. honecker but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising china for sending tanks against student demonstrators
1	against this background the new east german leader must move quickly to shore up his government's standing	the sudden growth of the opposition movement together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through poland and hungary has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-soviet workers' uprising in 1953
1	the surge in production raises questions about capacity outpacing demand	that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 when the current import trade restraint program ends which could result in more imports
1	we hope to sensitize employers to recognize the problems so they can do something about them	early intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long-term expense associated with hospitalization
1	hunt's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today's market depression	while some 100 million ounces of silver once held by mr. hunt and middle eastern associates aren't hanging over the market anymore the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use
1	silver's history of volatility is also discouraging investors	even in the present uncertain investment climate investors are preferring quality assets such as treasury bills and bonds to gold silver and platinum
1	the number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable	a shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy
1	long-term support for the december contract was believed to be at $1.25 a pound	there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract's price fell below it
1	that brought in considerable fund selling which continued until the close of trading	in general it was a bearish close
1	for those who delight in the misfortune of others read on	this is a story about suckers
1	john blodgett agrees -- and he ought to know	he used to be a boiler-room salesman peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins
1	the most obvious pitch of course is the lure of big returns	we're all a little greedy
1	we're all a little greedy	everyone is vulnerable
1	why do people play the lottery when the odds are great against them	people are shooting for a dream
1	at times salesmen may embellish the inside information with the notion that this is some slightly shady slightly illegal investment the person is being included in	in appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others
1	that for many investors the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement	once people got into it i was allowing them to live a dream
1	he phoned them with updates on the investment such as funny things that happened at the well that week	you gave them some excitement that they didn't have in their lives
1	conservative appearances make people think it's a conservative investment	people honestly lose money on risky investments that they didn't realize were a crapshoot
1	but hardly the only ones	the scams promise -- among other things -- to help save the environment feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children
1	psychologists say isolated people who don't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud	scam artists seek out such people -- or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves
1	that whatever a person's particular weak point timing is crucial	people may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives
1	people may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives	sometimes when people are making big changes retiring from their jobs moving to a new area they lose their bearings
1	sometimes when people are making big changes retiring from their jobs moving to a new area they lose their bearings	they may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time
1	these people aren't necessarily stupid or naive	almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized in some way
1	sales for the year rose nearly 30% to $5.28 billion from $4.07 billion a year earlier	the macintosh se/30 and iicx computers introduced in the winter for the brightened sales performance
1	the new hewlett-packard program is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing	in today's computer networks some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed
1	and the user of a computer won't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work	the task broker turns that network into -- as far as the user is concerned -- one giant computer
1	as hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another franchisers are struggling desperately for market share slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions	the fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees
1	the chains used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow but in the last year or so discounting has become a 12-month thing	though charisma's sales are up slightly this year mr. harty says profits will be flat or lower
1	with fast-food outlets on every corner he like many doesn't think he has a choice in the price war	our customers say that they won't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon
1	if the battle continues much longer many fast-food businesses will close or merge	the industry is overbuilt
1	the industry is overbuilt	fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available
1	quick-service restaurant units in the u.s. rose 14% to 131 146 between 1983 and 1987 the last year for which figures are available	with the market so crowded if you're doing well you're doing well at someone else's expense
1	the prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees	that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties or portion of sales that they must pay franchisers
1	in any case many franchisees in order to stay on good terms with franchisers routinely go along with promotions	if you resisted on prices maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise
1	but such tactics were alien to switzerland in 1976	eventually mr. rey was forced to sell his bally shares to the weapons maker oerlikon-buehrle holding ag as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the swiss old boys' network
1	bally was not an unfriendly takeover	buying from willing shareholders makes an unfriendly takeover impossible
1	but mr. rey brought about a merger in the next few years between the country's major producers	the increased efficiency has perked up the industry
1	and with the recent acquisition of 30% of winterthur-based machinery manufacturer gebrueder sulzer ag mr. rey has enjoyed the status of white knight	sulzer preferred him to financier tito tettamanti whose secretive raid on the company's stock had led to a bitter battle
1	for financial analysts reading omni's accounts is a tough challenge	companies move in and out
1	in august omni unexpectedly bought inspectorate's 80% stake in harpener ag of west germany a land-rich company	it makes sense for inspectorate-adia to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help
1	the move is yet another example of his conservatism	that companies with real estate give security
1	that companies with real estate give security	the real estate can be used as guarantees for bank loans for corporate development
1	he wants to influence but not manage companies	i don't want to be like {financier alan} bond and the other australians
1	future restructuring would be a question of strategy	we don't need the cash
1	it sees good opportunities in systems integration	we're getting only 10% of the integration dollars our customers are spending
1	he spends much time considering the possibility of a hostile takeover	we've been listed as a candidate for so long it's not worth worrying about
1	that money also would have to be borrowed	in effect mccaw has forced lin's hand by bidding $1.9 billion for the stake earlier this month
1	we're taking on more debt than we would have liked to	that the company wouldn't be profitable until 1994 or later
1	we're very pleased with the new deal	we didn't expect bellsouth to be so responsive
1	this is a superior deal to mccaw's	we're surprised
1	we're surprised	we didn't think a sleeping {bell} mentality would be willing to take on dilution
1	but kenneth leon a telecommunications analyst with bear stearns & co. finds the bellsouth proposal still flawed because the company doesn't have to wait five years to begin buying more lin shares	how many shares will be around in 1995
1	how many shares will be around in 1995?	there's nothing preventing bellsouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile
1	he hopes to improve client service	ogilvy under the fastidious mr. roman gained a reputation as occasionally being high-handed in its treatment of clients of preaching what strategy a client should -- indeed must -- follow
1	he also plans to get to know clients that mr. roman was closer to such as lever brothers american express and seagram	the two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins
1	the two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins	clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business -- not once a month but two or three times a week
1	under the reorganization ogilvy plans to name one executive on each account as a client service director to work as the client's single contact for all those services	there is little or no integration of our work quality is spotty there is no single focus
1	the one thing mr. phillips clearly does have going for him is continuity although it isn't certain if that will be enough	the last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top . . . and graham is obviously a long-term member of the ogilvy mafia as we call it
1	mr. klein decided to remove himself to minimize negative reaction from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense	the fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on y&r
1	british petroleum fell 5 to 286 on 14 million shares traded	the multinational oil company was pressured by recent brokerage recommendations urging investors to switch into shell trading & transport
1	in tokyo stocks closed lower but above intraday lows in active trading	the nikkei index was pressured down by profit-taking triggered by sharp advances made through this week and fell 151.20 points to 35527.29
1	if you take away the outside influences the market itself looks very cheap	what's happening here isn't justified by the fundamentals
1	because of the wild swings seen on the new york stock exchange last week	that's leaving small investors with cold feet and prompting institutions to take a reserved stance on the sidelines as well
1	share prices also closed lower in sydney hong kong singapore taipei manila wellington and seoul	concern about declines in other markets especially new york caused selling pressure
1	there's a distinct possibility that i may lose my job over this	her employer can't afford the rate increases
1	for employee and employer alike the worry is widespread	that small-business owners rank the availability and rising cost of health insurance as one of their biggest concerns
1	what we're seeing now makes a mockery of the idea of insurance: collect premiums from the healthy dump the sick and let them pay their own bills	some lawmakers may seek legislation to limit overly restrictive insurance policies
1	to woo the small-business market	as larger companies increasingly self-insure or use reserves to pay their own workers' medical bills the insurance industry has turned to the small-employer market that was once a backwater for them
1	one case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant and rates go up 40% to 60%	small-business people end up paying insurance premiums worth two to three times the cost of one illness
1	i'm not accusing insurers of dereliction of duty	you can't ask one carrier to underwrite on social grounds when that might destroy it in the marketplace
1	but first on the list of priorities is to prohibit state laws requiring the inclusion of specialty items such as psychiatric care in basic health plans	such requirements make it difficult to provide a basic low-cost health-benefits package
1	that studies completed after the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a source of volatility	the issues that are (now) being raised in classic anti-intellectual fashion fly in the face of a number of post-crash studies
1	stock-index funds have grown in popularity over the past decade as pension funds and other institutional investors have sought a low-cost way to match the performance of the stock market as a whole	many money managers who trade stock actively have trouble consistently matching the s&p-500's returns
1	morgan stanley's trading halt for its own account is likely to shake up firms such as kidder peabody & co. that still do such trades for their own account	morgan stanley has consistently been one of the top stock-index arbitrage traders in recent months
1	we have to clear up these issues and find out what is present that is creating artificial volatility	there is no question that investor confidence (in the stock market) is critical
1	that different rules governing stock and futures markets are partly responsible for volatility	these rules permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks which frequently knocks the two markets out of line
1	but under alan greenspan that has changed	a supremely cautious man the fed chairman is forever blinking yellow
1	indeed his caution has become legendary within the government	he fusses endlessly over economic statistics dissecting them in dozens of ways probing for hours in search of potential problems
1	the administration's concerns are understandable	the economy is showing signs of weakness particularly among manufacturers
1	we've gotten through two stock market crashes and we've gone through an election without any major problems	i think you have to give greenspan a good rating
1	why had mr. korotich been called	that he was taking my butt to the central committee so they can . . . whack whack whack his hand made vigorous spanking gestures on his left palm
1	so they can . . . whack whack whack his hand made vigorous spanking gestures on his left palm	they feel the need from time to time to `educate' me
1	the day after that conversation at the residence of the u.s. ambassador the brezhnevite editor of pravda victor afnasjev was replaced by a college classmate of mr. gorbachev's	brezhnevite holdovers have more to fear from mr. gorbachev than the verbal spanking he gave to the press
1	glasnost has made celebrities of men like mr. korotich	prevented by the communist party from getting on its slate of nominees for the new supreme soviet he stood as an independent candidate for congress from his native ukraine and won with 84% of the vote
1	but as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are there is a fragility to glasnost	censorship isn't a marxist invention
1	i'd be destroying myself replies mr. korotich who then asks what would that accomplish	his answer reveals his vulnerability
1	ratners which controls 25% of the british jewelry market would increase the number of its u.s. stores to about 450 stores from 360	it hopes to control 5% of jewelry business in the u.s. by 1992
1	that's where the two scripts would diverge	in affidavits filed in los angeles superior court in connection with the $1 billion breach-of-contract suit warner brought against sony for hiring the two producers mr. guber and mr. peters tell one story.
1	warner denies mr. ross ever said any such thing and in fact denies virtually everything mr. guber and mr. peters say in their affidavits	tomorrow warner will file another batch of documents contending that the essence of everything these guys are saying is basically lies
1	to screen the picture without telling stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell or mr. peters	the less they know the easier it is for us
1	the less they know the easier it is for us	if someone asks just lie and tell them it will be done
1	but sony is a problem	warner is particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge japanese company controlling important segments of the u.s. entertainment business
1	the studio still wants the producers to come back and fulfill their contract	they are like a mini-studio; they have 50 projects in development for warner
1	upset over the use of what it says are its exclusive trademarks hells angels motorcycle corp. is fighting back -- in court	concord new horizons corp. creators of a 1988 movie called nam angels used the gang's name and trademarks without authorization
1	there is absolutely no way our board or membership would have approved the portrayal of the hells angels in this movie	portrayal of our members as disloyal to each other is totally contrary to the most important values of our organization -- loyalty and trust
1	for them it makes all kinds of sense	they've been given a mandate from switzerland to expand their u.s. chocolate operations
1	if the case is converted to chapter 7 what remains of the oil tycoon's once-vast estate -- now believed to have a value of less than $125 million -- would be sold off quickly with most of the proceeds going to the internal revenue service whose claim for $300 million in back taxes has priority in the case	hundreds of smaller creditors could get nothing according to attorneys involved
1	it would be a shame to have a chapter 7 after all the progress in this case	under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code a company continues to operate under protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts
1	since deregulation of the market in 1985 producers have become much more intensely involved in both transportation and marketing	it's a matter of being close to those suppliers
1	having more than a token presence here should enhance communications and business relationships	since the cost of transporting gas is so important to producers' ability to sell it it helps to have input and access to transportation companies
1	if a tv weatherman gets butterflies facing the camera again after a questionable forecast donald h. straszheim surely understands	the chief economist of merrill lynch & co. finds himself in such a position as he buzzes the midwest on his first road trip since backpedaling on a major prediction
1	and he's right	since the last time he traveled this way several months ago he has recanted a series of bold forecasts of a recession
1	mr. shilling who was merrill lynch's chief economist from 1967 to 1971 has heralded a recession for months	my own personal opinion is that don threw in the towel just about the time he should have doubled his bet
1	however risky the business it's brisk these days	wall street economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the dinkiest monthly indicator
1	mr. straszheim meets confrontation that often occurs in inverse proportion to the size of the client	no sophisticated professional expects economists to be right all the time
1	mr. shilling understands mr. straszheim's problems	there's unbelievable pressure on economists to forecast these numbers
1	there's unbelievable pressure on economists to forecast these numbers	you make a forecast
1	it is indeed hard to back away from a widely publicized forecast and mr. straszheim is fidgeting with the handcuffs on this trip	his approach to the recantation is direct but low-key
1	whether georgia pacific will ultimately prevail	you have to watch out for counterbids
1	the fibers business now accounts for only 20% of akzo's sales	we have definitely become less cyclical
1	still akzo hasn't yet found a way to achieve another goal: a large presence in the u.s. market for prescription drugs	prices for u.s. pharmaceutical companies remain too high making it unlikely that akzo will pursue any major acquisitions in that area
1	maybe akzo can surprise the investment world a bit	akzo is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year
1	in august for example it completed the $110 million acquisition of reliance universal inc. a u.s. maker of industrial coatings for wood metals and plastics from tyler corp	akzo is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale
1	these are curious times in south african politics	the government and the anc the bitterest of enemies are engaged in an elaborate mating dance designed to entice each other to the negotiating table
1	the government and the anc the bitterest of enemies are engaged in an elaborate mating dance designed to entice each other to the negotiating table	pretoria releases the anc leaders most of whom were serving life sentences and allows them to speak freely hoping that the anc will abandon its use of violence
1	speakers yesterday called on foreign governments to increase sanctions against pretoria and urged supporters inside the country to continue defying emergency restrictions and racial segregation known as apartheid	we cannot wait on the government to make changes at its own pace
1	there can be no question of us unilaterally abandoning the armed struggle	to date we see no clear indication that the government is serious about negotiations
1	to date we see no clear indication that the government is serious about negotiations	all their utterances are vague
1	that the price wars flaring up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year	the move toward standard operating systems means customers aren't locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down
1	he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $2 a share from $3	i was feeling like i was too high to begin with
1	that fujitsu said it is now offering to withdraw from the project	from a common-sense viewpoint it was not socially acceptable
1	because we want experience in the field	we expect a big market in the future
1	the municipal government had budgeted about 11 million yen ($77 500) for the project	i was flabbergasted
1	i was flabbergasted	i understand the firm's enthusiasm in getting the deal but such a large company would have been better off showing a little more discretion
1	and will take measures so this kind of thing doesn't happen in the future	it's contrary to common sense
1	that will show water lines throughout the city	the system could be used in a fire or earthquake to locate problems among other things
1	the hiroshima contract will help it secure pacts with other municipalities	japanese local governments are expected to invest heavily in computer systems over the next few years and many companies expect that field to provide substantial revenue
1	that a one million share buy-back program announced in march is substantially complete	the company which makes integrated circuits and other electronic parts now has about 47 million common shares outstanding
1	that he expects the company to benefit from some of the disruption faced by our competitors	while our competitors are concerned with their financial viability and possible ownership changes we will be concentrating on buying and selling merchandise our customers need and want
1	where does mr. lehman get off castigating gen. george marshall for muscling in on naval prerogatives	ever since the days of alfred thayer mahan (u.s. naval officer and naval historian) and teddy roosevelt the navy has been the service most favored by washington officialdom
1	so two weeks ago thousands of brooks brothers charge customers -- customers conditioned to wait for twice-yearly clearance sales -- got a surprise: an invitation to come in and buy any one item for 25% off	during the four-day promotion shoppers at the short hills n.j. store lined up to pay for big-ticket items like coats and suits
1	one color photo displays a rainbow of dress shirts tied in a knot; another picture shows neckties with bold designs	the message is loud and clear: this is not your father's brooks brothers
1	that shaking its time-honored traditions will attract more young men and more women and change consumer perceptions about its range of merchandise	we have men who only buy their shirts and underwear here or younger customers who only buy their {job} interview suit here
1	as brooks brothers jumps into the fashion fray it will be playing catch up	many clothiers especially ralph lauren have cashed in on the recent popularity of updated ivy league and english styles
1	despite these challenges marks & spencer sees big potential in brooks brothers noting the widely recognized name and global presence	marks & spencer plans to open roughly 18 more u.s. stores in the next five years
1	the centerpiece of the overhaul according to mr. roberti is the men's tailored clothing department where brooks brothers has added new suit styles and fabrics	the perception out there is that we are very conservative and we only sell one type of suit
1	and the producers of one new arrival are a bit desperate	homeroom a show about a black ad executive who gives up the boardroom for a fourth-grade classroom is flunking the ratings test
1	so producers alyce and topper carew spun their rolodexes and gathered names of black opinion makers to mount a direct-mail campaign	by wooing a core black audience they figure they might keep the show alive at least until the spring semester
1	i think it is a nail in the coffin in any royalty tax proposal	what {the report} shows is everything we've been saying for the past eight or nine years -- that audio taping is the best thing to happen for the recording industry
1	that audio taping is the best thing to happen for the recording industry	the people who tape the most buy the most
1	companies that actually market speed as part of their service train their managers to lead and participate in teams that increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations	managers learn to spot opportunities to increase customer satisfaction through speed and shift some responsibility for analyzing improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees
1	the packages must be sorted quickly and distributed to smaller vans for delivery so couriers can be on the road by 8:35	no customer is present at the morning package sort but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction
1	we're committed to deliver the customer's package by a stated time usually 10:30	the sooner our vans hit the road each morning the easier it is for us to fulfill that obligation
1	each department developed its specialized contribution to the proposal submitting data and cost estimates on a closely managed schedule	we cleared up questions and inconsistencies very quickly because the people who had the skills and perspective required to resolve them were part of the task team
1	managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction	they effectively lead team efforts to reduce cycle time
1	it also placed on creditwatch for possible downgrade other securities including the double-b-minus/b rating of crossland's certificates of deposit and the single-b rating of its senior subordinated capital notes	about $518 million of debt is affected
1	however the resolve of some of the striking 57 000 machinists might be weakening	about 1 000 strikers signed petitions last week calling for boeing and machinists representatives to schedule new meetings
1	its military business is feeling the effects of a declining defense budget after a strong buildup during the reagan presidency	in may the company consolidated its aerospace and electronics groups; the new defense and space group will contain the aerospace and electronics division and advanced systems both based in the seattle area; boeing helicopters in philadelphia; boeing military airplanes in wichita kan. and argosystems in sunnyvale calif
1	it's a further step to better returns in the hemorrhaging defense business	they had to do it
1	westinghouse's earnings could be materially enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner	the company expects a need for 140 000 megawatts of new generation in the u.s. over the next decade
1	westinghouse's own role as a supplier also is changing	in the past the company usually took token equity positions in power plants it supplied as a kicker to close deals
1	that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable	she could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit
1	the confusion could be costly	currency traders suspecting mr. major won't defend the pound strenuously sent the british currency sharply lower friday against the dollar and west german mark
1	a continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base rate currently 15%	that could shove a weak economy into recession
1	that would leave mrs. thatcher little room for maneuver	for the tories to win the next election voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year beforehand
1	though mrs. thatcher doesn't need to call an election until june 1992 she would prefer doing so in late 1991	if the economy shows no sign of turning around in about year's time she will be very vulnerable
1	despite the departure of mr. lawson and sir alan the tug-of-war over the ems could continue	sir geoffrey howe deputy prime minister and a lawson ally on the ems has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership
1	of immediate concern is whether the thatcher government will continue mr. lawson's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the west german bundesbank and responding in kind when the frankfurt authorities move interest rates	mrs. thatcher doesn't like taking orders from foreigners
1	we won't have any more of this wayward behavior	the party is fed up with sackings of good people
1	it's an unrealistic expectation	as long as a decade ago mrs. thatcher declared she didn't want debate in her cabinet; she wanted strong government
1	in delaware chancery court litigation telerate has criticized dow jones for not disclosing that telerate's management expects the company's revenue to increase by 20% annually while dow jones based its projections of telerate's performance on a 12% revenue growth forecast	in the tender offer supplement dow jones discloses the different growth forecasts but says it views the 20% growth rate as a hoped-for goal of telerate's management and not as a realistic basis on which to project the company's likely future performance
1	the former comes from the latest wave of political activism in hollywood especially around feminist issues such as abortion.	put these together and you get programs about rape
1	he quotes one student saying you're just the kind of jewboy we southerners can't stand	that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now a dweller on one of the two islands off the coast of america
1	not to judge by settle the score in which mr. sohmer seems to be settling a score of his own	of all the unflattering portraits of small-town america i've seen on tv this film is the most gratuitously nasty
1	but in mr. sohmer's ozarks he is but the tip of the patriarchal iceberg	every man kate encounters is either sniggeringly puritanical viciously patronizing revoltingly lecherous or all three
1	but we know from the outset that he's not a member of the evil patriarchy	how could he be
1	how could he be	he's the director of the local planned parenthood chapter
1	her sister-in-law (amy wright) is a sniveling prude afraid that kate will seduce all the married men in town including a particularly loathsome fellow named tucker whose idea of fun is to leave his wife at home tending to her bruises and cigarette burns while he bullies kate into a dance that consists of drooling on her while trying to break her ribs	at the very least it would appear that sis is a poor judge of masculine charm
1	it is a peaceful time in this part of western india	the summer crop is harvested winter sowing has yet to begin
1	ever since the link to cholesterol was disclosed americans have begun scarfing up psyllium in their breakfast cereals	if further research proves the seed's benefits this dusty farm district could become the epicenter of a health-food fad to rival all fads since cod-liver oil
1	this seed's not grown anywhere else in india or anywhere else in the world	the proper climatic conditions don't exist in many places in the world
1	only one thing is certain here: pysllium is likely to remain solely an export item from sidhpur for a long time	local farmers say it is as good a cash crop as mustard or fenugreek a legume.
1	but some time ago researchers discovered that soluble fibers also lower cholesterol levels in the blood	cincinnati-based p&g took an interest
1	cincinnati-based p&g took an interest	it ordered two studies on psyllium and cholesterol
1	after 16 weeks the group that took three daily teaspoons of metamucil saw a significant dip in their general cholesterol levels and an even larger reduction in levels of low-density lipoproteins the so-called bad cholesterol	in late 1987 p&g asked the fda for approval to market metamucil as the first non-prescription cholesterol-lowering product in the
1	in april the psyllium bandwagon got more crowded	general mills inc. the food giant launched a breakfast cereal called benefit containing psyllium oat wheat and beet bran
1	suddenly on television in advertisements and on their cereal boxes americans were inundated with news about the obscure seed	the flood of claims and counter-claims worried consumers and actually hurt sales of the new cereals
1	psyllium's not a good crop	you get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined
1	even at the basic chemicals pharmaceuticals and cosmetics export promotion council the government agency that promotes the seed the psyllium boom is distant thunder	the staff brags about psyllium's hefty contribution to american regularity without quite grasping the implications of the research on cholesterol
1	without quite grasping the implications of the research on cholesterol	the council's annual report has psyllium on its last page lumped with such unglamorous export items as sarsaparilla and nux vomica a plant that induces vomiting
1	in one way the psyllium middlemen -- the buyers and exporters -- are glad to keep news of the boom to themselves	they want psyllium prices low for their purchases next year
1	psyllium needs sandy soil dew during the first few weeks and then total dryness when its seeds are maturing	small crops are grown in pakistan france spain italy belgium and brazil but their quality can't compare to that of indian psyllium
1	we're sorry to see nigel lawson's departure from the british government	he is a politician with the courage of true conviction as in summarily sacking exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to 40%
1	british politicians divide into two groups of chickens those with their necks cut and those screaming the sky is falling	so far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues: mr. lawson and sir alan walters the counterpoint of the chancellor's difficulties who also resigned as personal adviser to mrs. thatcher
1	in the british case mr. lawson is the closest thing in london to a supply-side globalist	he not only slashed marginal tax rates initially sparking fresh growth in britain but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates indeed joining the european monetary system
1	at this point the options were: crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates as sir alan surely advised and forget the soaring pound	to push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit a policy britain has repeatedly proved disastrous
1	but this devastated the u.s. manufacturing sector laying the seeds of protectionism	mr. lawson though not allowed to join the ems chose to shadow the deutsche mark
1	mr. lawson though not allowed to join the ems chose to shadow the deutsche mark	he reaped inflation along with rapid growth no doubt validating sir alan's predictions in the prime minister's mind
1	that mr. roberts not only chides the chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling but also led the chorus saying that mr. volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise	somewhere in between there must be a golden mean perhaps measured by m-whatever but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity
1	that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus	that the retirement of gilts for cash is equivalent to an expansionary open-market operation
1	all the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy	better to have a true monetarist policy just for the experience
1	what mr. major and mrs. thatcher will do now remains to be seen	they confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy that is to say stagflation
1	this cannot be solved by provoking a further downturn	reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation
1	immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money	this was the version of supply-side economics that in the late 1970s and early '80s worked in america and world-wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflicts britain today
1	but picking frank lloyd wright to say it for you was a bad call	wright's organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment decades before it became fashionable among la-la activists
1	the illogic and inaccuracy of john h. adams's comments for the national resources defense council fully justifies your characterization of california's greens in particular as la-la activists	we may all hope that california's voters will heed the scientific realities that their own university's renowned prof.
1	czechoslovakia has restricted consumer-goods exports to neighbor countries because of massive buying out of food by tourists from poland hungary and the soviet union	rising inflation in poland and hungary makes czechoslovak food clothing and shoes relatively cheap for visitors from these countries
1	it will ban sex and violence from state-owned television next year	many programs we have now come from the west and are not suitable to our culture
1	until his resignation mr. lawson had been conducting british monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark	when mrs. thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40% mr. lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark
1	with inflation surging the pound began falling against the mark	to keep the exchange rate pegged mr. lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15%
1	this put mrs. thatcher in a bind	the concept of european integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals the media and the imagination but are full of practical pitfalls
1	the price of attracting capital -- whether one's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit	to avoid this deficit mr. lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise
1	consequently mr. lawson saddled mrs. thatcher with a record trade deficit renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row	little wonder that mrs. thatcher's opponents were so anxious to keep mr. lawson in office
1	it is extraordinary that the british treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound	the british balance-of-payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to 40% the flow abroad of british capital slowed to 50 billion pounds ($79 billion at the current rate) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986.
1	the most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates	this has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle
1	britain and all of europe need to reconsider the prospects for european integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of germany	a unified germany that remained within the western alliance would give germany such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified europe would become vassals of the german state
1	unless the soviet union collapses german reunification is likely to require germany's neutralization	the implications for britain france and the rest of europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge mr. lawson's resignation to be unfortunate
1	members of the audience gasped or laughed nervously	their industry has been unsettled recently by acquisitions
1	first unilever the anglo-dutch packaged-goods giant spent $2 billion to acquire brands such as faberge and elizabeth arden	it now holds the no. 3 position at u.s. department-store cosmetic counters
1	p&g and unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout sparking fear	though it is far from certain that companies best known for selling promise margarine and tide detergent will succeed in cosmetics there's little doubt they will shake up the industry
1	but some cosmetics-industry executives wonder whether techniques honed in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business	estee lauder inc. revlon inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives
1	the moisturizer introduced in 1962 had a dowdy image	oil of olay brought with it the baggage of being used basically by older women who had already aged
1	p&g set out to reposition the brand by broadening the product line to include facial cleansers and moisturizers for sensitive skin.	the company says sales have soared
1	the presence of unilever and p&g is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics	while the two are among the world's biggest advertisers most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads
1	the packaged-goods marketers may try filling that gap with a spate of new products	unlike the old-line cosmetics houses unilever and p&g both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products
1	there will be more emphasis on quality	you'll see fewer gimmicks
1	unilever already has experienced some disappointment	the mass-market aziza brand which it acquired in 1987 along with chesebrough-pond's inc. has lost share according to industry analysts
1	the ritzy world of department-store cosmetics retailing where unilever is concentrating its efforts may prove even more treacherous	in this niche makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to ready-to-wear fashions
1	in this niche makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to ready-to-wear fashions	because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are unplanned careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important
1	ground batteries targeting an odd assortment of aircraft traveling at highly unusual speeds opened up a furious fusillade	the sky filled with 12.8-pound shells several of which fell back to earth destroying homes and buildings
1	gerald ford a fairly down-to-earth fellow once sent a letter to the chairman of the armed services committee recommending that there be a committee investigation of the ufo phenomenon	we owe it to the american people to establish credibility regarding ufos and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on the subject
1	maybe some of our talk-show hosts and anchors have already been taken over	the point of this 1955 novel which spawned two movies is that the soulless pod people replicated by alien plants are virtually indistinguishable from human folks
1	the apparent crash became top secret and the alien creatures went away upset with the rude ways of human beings	we lost our chance to communicate with sweet-natured visitors about four feet tall {who} looked as though they were made of puffed-up marshmallow
1	nashua's intention is to remain an independent public company	it amended its shareholder rights plan by reducing to 10% from 20% the level of ownership by an outsider that would trigger the issuance to other holders of rights to buy additional shares of nashua common at half price
1	that while nashua's performance this year has been atrocious the company nonetheless is attractive as a classic breakup candidate because there's no similarity between its {four} businesses	the breakup value at $55 a share
1	the u.s. had been under pressure from several cocom members especially france west germany and italy to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools which those countries argued were now widely available to east bloc countries from non-cocom members	for several years some european countries have complained that outdated cocom lists and restrictions served more to hamper their trade than to add to western security
1	on days when prices are tumbling they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will	in such an environment market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares
1	but this skittishness is creating liquidity problems in certain otc stocks	it's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers don't want to {take the orders
1	these big stocks greatly influence the nasdaq composite index	when the computers say sell the composite tumbles as well as the dow jones industrial average
1	lin broadcasting surged 4 5/8 to 112 5/8	lin and bellsouth sweetened their merger agreement in an attempt to keep shareholders from tendering their shares to mccaw cellular communications
1	the only consensus is that more money and people may leave hong kong than had been thought likely	this expected blow has cast a pall over the economy's prospects
1	investors have to accept the possibility of a significant slowdown in economic activity in the runup to 1997	over the next few years i would advise caution
1	during the past 10 years hong kong's economic growth has averaged 8.3% annually	given hong kong's record mr. mushkat's realists might have sounded unduly conservative when the interviews took place two years ago
1	that global forces will continue to govern hong kong's economic rhythm	once external conditions such as u.s. demand swing in the territory's favor local businessmen will probably overcome their 1997 worries and continue doing business as usual
1	it is clear that most of the effect of increasing education has been to shift who is helping the wife/mother	her share decreases but only slightly
1	a quake that measures two on the richter isn't twice as severe as a one -- it's 10 times worse.	that put the seven of oct. 17 in perspective for me
1	that put the seven of oct. 17 in perspective for me	think i'll buy one of those i survived t-shirts after all
1	but a trifle unfair otherwise	they showed up but didn't -- or couldn't -- challenge
1	the best team won this series which is more unusual than it may sound	baseball ain't football where the good teams beat up on the bad ones
1	the best baseball teams win six of 10 games and the worst win four of 10	that several recent champions of the world according to us (as in u.s.) might not have ranked no. 1 in many polls
1	these a's however got few grades as low as b on their 1989 report card	they led the major leagues in regular-season wins with 99 and flattened the toronto blue jays four games to one for the american league pennant before stomping their cross-bay rivals
1	the sole a not to homer was cleanup hitter mark mcgwire their regular-season leader with 33 and he contributed five hits plus a diving fielding play on a ground ball in game three that stopped a giant rally while the issue still was in doubt	think i'll redo my image -- get this changed to a glove
1	even with that power show though the oakland series' star certified by the most valuable player award was a pitcher dave stewart	he shut out the giants on five hits in game one and allowed three runs on five hits in seven innings friday after the 12-day break caused by the earthquake
1	that sandy alderson the team's general manager felt obliged to dampen it	people change teams change he cautioned
1	further staff cuts are likely	obviously we are looking at making economies across the board
1	tvs blames difficulties in peddling reruns of mtm shows to u.s. broadcasters for the problems at mtm	the market for reruns sold to local u.s. broadcasters has been weak for the past three or four seasons
1	sansui is a special case	it expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen
1	nor do analysts expect the sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases	if the strong yen and the high stock prices of japanese companies weren't deterrents enough webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly japanese companies and fiercely independent japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers
1	as the yen soared in recent years sansui's deepening financial problems became a vicious circle	while competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of japanese factories sansui lacked the money to build new plants in southeast asia
1	sansui lacked the money to build new plants in southeast asia	our company has not been able to cope very effectively with changes in the marketplace
1	his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future	attitudes {toward being acquired} are still negative but they're becoming more positive
1	mr. nadir brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn sansui around	sansui is a perfect fit for polly peck's electronics operations which make televisions videocassette recorders microwaves and other products on an original equipment maker basis for sale under other companies' brand names
1	it lowered its rating on about $400 million of this bank holding company's senior debt to b2 from ba3	moody's said it expects valley national of phoenix ariz. to make substantial further provisions against its real-estate portfolio and that it continues to suffer from the high cost of carrying nonperforming assets and from high loan-loss provisions
1	in today's markets specialists (on the new york stock exchange) and upstairs market makers (in the over-the-counter market) are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process	when they halt trading all market liquidity is gone
1	when that happened seismic tremors of fear coursed through the market and increased the market's volatility	lack of important needed information can cause fear
1	because of a lack of information and access many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed because of their ignorance of important market information	to add aftershock-damping power to america's markets a modern electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena (and the information that would automatically accompany such access) by investors -- particularly institutional investors
1	in an open electronic system any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve (buy and sell orders at each price) entered by dealers and investors alike and to enter and execute orders	current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants -- not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis
1	we are not in any hurry to sell saks marshall field or b.a.t's other u.s. retail properties	this isn't a distress sale
1	this isn't a distress sale	we are determined to get good prices
1	i want to know who made the decision that it was safe for 186 000 people to use every day	he would convene hearings within two weeks
1	they were as surprised as anyone by the cypress destruction	previous earthquakes suggested that multiple-column viaducts would stand up well
1	but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from bringing home the bacon to their respective constituencies	each legislator after all is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making
1	in races for the white house a voter's incentive at the margin is to lean republican	although a gop president may limit local benefits to the voter's particular district/state such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits
1	such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits	the individual voter's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes
1	potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a democratic opponent	to the extent that potential republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game works to their disadvantage the republican party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates
1	that gop senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than democrats do	to the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns
1	the british firm has begun court proceedings in london to prevent the use of the name deloitte by deloitte haskins & sells and touche ross & co. in england and the rest of the world	the british deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of deloitte and touche world-wide and joined coopers & lybrand
1	the decision to start these proceedings hasn't been taken lightly	the british firm has used the name deloitte since 1845
1	general motors corp. a deloitte audit client for example has agreed to keep its annual $18 million world-wide audit and associated tax work with the merged deloitte-touche firm	in england this would mean that the british deloitte would lose revenue for its audit of gm's vauxhill unit
1	bonn and washington have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries pledging billions of dollars in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial nations to follow suit	both hope to encourage pressure for change in east bloc countries still ruled by stalinist holdouts by arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for poland hungary and to a lesser extent the soviet union
1	a surprising choice but given the swedish academy's past perversities hardly the most undeserved and ridiculous accolade handed out by the awarding committee	in spain anyway the 73-year-old mr. cela enjoys some renown for the novels and travel books he wrote during the parched franco years
1	for vietnamese these are tricky often treacherous times	after years of hesitation economic and political reform was embraced at the end of 1986 but ringing declarations have yet to be translated into much action
1	and demanded proof the house and equipment were his	he produced it
1	but a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property	warned he was to be jailed again he fled to the countryside
1	his family was given three hours to leave before the house and contents were confiscated	with only the clothes they were wearing family members moved to a home owned by one of mr. chan's sons
1	after six months on the run mr. chan learned the order for his arrest had been canceled	he rejoined his family in january 1984 and began the long struggle for justice pressing everyone from hanoi municipal officials to national assembly deputies for restoration of his rights
1	mr. ngoc 57 years old had solid reformist credentials	he had lost his official position in the association in he early 1980s because he questioned the intrusion of politics into literature
1	those who manage ideology and a large number of writers reacted badly to the restyled paper	after months of internal rumblings mr. ngoc was fired last december

1	white 24 years old a singer in her church choir she symbolizes a generation that gave its heart and its vote to ronald reagan	i felt kind of safe
1	no longer	when the supreme court opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion ms. ehman opened her mind to democratic politics
1	the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for mr. courter	unless he closes the gap republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month
1	this change comes less from a shift in public opinion than in the boundaries of the debate	new jersey's own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion but the u.s. supreme court ruling webster vs.
1	he doesn't know himself	even abortion opponents however angry with mr. florio can't hide their frustration with the republican's ambivalence
1	in the opinion of many he hasn't stopped running since	his base in south jersey and on the house energy and commerce committee helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge
1	a toxic-waste-dump fire destroyed part of an interstate highway this summer	in monmouth an important swing area republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county clean and green
1	but at age 52 the congressman is also a product of his times and losses	he speaks for the death penalty as if reading from exodus 21
1	but his ties to camden remain a sore point because of the county's past corruption	his campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater trenton state college
1	i am a devout catholic	i can't support him because of abortion
1	if you want more opinions ask my wife	she has lots of opinions
1	that the streamlining was temporary	other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts
1	it's back to tax-give-away time for the select few	next year every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on lloyd bentsen's door on danny rostenkowski's door
1	even lobbyists for heavy industry are encouraged	the return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and iras creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation (write-offs) or investment credits
1	real-estate interests for example are protesting an omission in president bush's capital-gains proposal: it doesn't include real-estate gains	if there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains they certainly want to be part of it
1	but sotheby's christie's and the national association of antique dealers are still trying to get theirs	they have sent a letter to congressional tax-writers asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment
1	all of this talk is antithetical to the tax reform act of 1986	in exchange for dramatically lower tax rates the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others
1	this year congress with prodding from president bush has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code	it appears likely that this year or next some form of capital-gains preference and passive-loss restoration will be enacted
1	the '86 act was a fluke	they wanted reform and they got a revolution
1	mr. juliano thinks so	one recent saturday morning he stayed inside the capitol monitoring tax-and-budget talks instead of flying to san francisco for a fund-raiser and then to his hometown of chicago for the 30th reunion of st. ignatius high school
1	i'm too old to waste a weekend but that's what i did	these days anything can happen
1	but many economists were not nearly as jubilant	the climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months
1	i think inflation is going to pick up through the fall	it has been in what i would describe as a lull for the past several months
1	but lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge	protections afforded government agencies in such cases are pretty ironclad
1	for now the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued or whether they have liability or not	we still have people wandering around in a daze in san francisco worrying about whether it's going to rain tonight
1	but that won't stop plaintiffs' lawyers from seeking a little room for maneuvering	in san francisco an earthquake was a near certainty
1	he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage	he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse
1	that the facts of each case must be looked at individually	a lot of this is going to be code-related
1	a lot of this is going to be code-related	plaintiffs will argue that damaged structures weren't built to proper design standards
1	under the statute agencies are provided defenses that normally aren't available in the private sector	the legislature does not want to inhibit the unique government activities by exposing public entities to liability
1	if there's going to be a race to the courthouse it hasn't started yet	mr. covert had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday and mr. belli's courtyard was strewn with bricks
1	wednesday mr. belli's staff wasn't permitted into his office by city officials worried about their safety	he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town-house office and helped victims apply for federal aid -- free of charge
1	stock and bond investors were cheered by last month's encouragingly low inflation rate	this news raised hopes for further interest-rate cuts
1	this news raised hopes for further interest-rate cuts	treasury-bond prices immediately rallied setting the stock market rolling from the opening bell
1	fed officials probably won't drive down rates immediately	despite the inflation news several fed officials still fear consumer-price pressures will intensify because they insist the economy is stronger than generally believed
1	investors also are anxious about today's witching hour	this phenomenon often makes stock prices swing wildly at the end of the trading session
1	but mr. rudman also succeeded in attaching language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed	the effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until oct. 1 next year
1	the two banks appear to be a good fit	banponce caters to a more affluent customer while banco popular has always had a large presence among middle-income and lower-income markets
1	the merger will result in a larger and stronger locally based bank	we'll be able to better compete with large foreign banks
1	we'll be able to better compete with large foreign banks	it makes sense from a strategic standpoint
1	the merger to face any regulatory hurdles	the merger should be completed in six to nine months
1	the three-month-old strike at nynex seriously hurt the installation of new telephone lines in the quarter	access lines in service at the end of the quarter were off 18 000 from the previous quarter
1	this is a good quarter for us in terms of our business fundamentals	new telephone lines increased 4.5% for a total of about $13.5 million for the quarter; toll calls increased 9.6% to 807 million and minutes of telephone usage increased to 9.9 billion
1	maybe it was their peculiar sense of history	the broadcasters were after all documenting the game ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the stick
1	the broadcasters were after all documenting the game ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the stick	why not watch or hear your experience historicized while you were living it
1	the day was saturated with the weight of its own impending history	long lines of people waited to buy special souvenir world series postcards with official postmarks
1	players ran out on the field way below and the stands began to reverberate	it must be a local custom stamping feet to welcome the team
1	and realized what had happened	what should i do
1	i was an eyewitness of the most newsworthy event on the planet at that moment	what was my angle
1	the rest is of course history	the stick didn't fall
1	it was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the stick that i really understood the point of all those walkmen and watchmen	the crowd moved in clumps clumps magnetized around an electronic nucleus
1	in fact the entire population of the bay area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience	the reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters

1	the decision is a setback for president bush	having a proposal sponsored by democrats would have given the president an advantage
1	that the tax cut would be enacted this year	a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction
1	mr. mitchell's first victory came last week when the senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that didn't contain a capital-gains provision	that vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill

1	nevertheless the bush administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in july	according to officials in washington the state department hoped that by pleasing president arias it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the contras until after mr. ortega's promises of democratic elections were tested next february
1	aid was also the gist of the talks sen. dodd had with salvadoran president alfredo cristiani	mr. cristiani's government is very much at the mercy of u.s. largess and is forced to listen very carefully to sen. dodd's likes and dislikes
1	it was therefore not surprising that close allies of the u.s. virtually neglected by the bush administration ordered the nicaraguan insurgents dismantled by december long before the elections	fittingly the tela accords were nicknamed by hondurans the dodd plan
1	since mr. shevardnadze's proposals followed discussions with mr. baker speculations arose that the bush administration was seeking an accommodation with the soviets in central america	this scheme would fit the arias plan which declared a false symmetry between soviet military aid to the sandinista dictatorship and that provided by washington to freely elected governments
1	it is capable of reaching the entire caribbean area and deep into north america	perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the soviet condominium being created in the isthmus thanks to u.s. default

1	democracy can be cruel to politicians	sometimes it forces them to make choices
1	they've been shielded the most	so long as abortion was a question for litigation not legislation republicans could find political security in absolutism
1	so long as abortion was a question for litigation not legislation republicans could find political security in absolutism	they could attract one-issue voters by adopting the right-to-life movement's strongest position even as pro-choice republicans knew this mattered little on an issue monopolized by the court
1	last friday after congress passed it anyway he hinted he was looking for compromise	was the man who once was pro-choice but later pro-life converting again
1	in fact mr. bush's dance was more wiggle than waffle	the white house never wavered over the veto
1	and mr. bush quickly signaled a veto	amid charges of timidity on panama and elsewhere the president wasn't about to offend his most energetic constituency
1	now many republicans are listening	they're frightened by what they see in new jersey and especially virginia where pro-life gop candidates for governor are being pummeled on abortion
1	but the supreme court's opening of debate may have changed even that	that the single-issue voters had about evened out
1	in the case of hhs secretary louis sullivan the litmus test could yet damage issues important to other parts of the republican coalition	after mr. sullivan waffled on abortion last year the white house appeased right-to-lifers by surrounding him with pro-life deputies
1	though democrats can gloat at all this for now they may want to contain their glee	on abortion their own day will come
1	on abortion their own day will come	eventually even republicans will find a way to frame the issue in ways that expose pro-choice absolutism
1	now the ambivalent middle a moral majority of sorts is reasserting itself	within a few years the outcome in most states is likely to be that abortion will be more restricted but not completely banned

1	its third-quarter earnings declined by more than half	lower chemical prices reduced gasoline margins and refinery maintenance shutdowns
1	but foreign exploration and production earnings fell sharply to $12 million from $95 million	higher oil prices weren't enough to offset a roughly $20 million charge related to a 10% reduction in amoco's canadian work force as well as increased exploration expenses

1	chandler might have been predicting the course of his own career	his last published novel featuring private detective philip marlowe the inferior playback (1958) at times read almost like a parody of his previous work

1	first there's the name: asset-backed securities	better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing
1	well think twice	the concept may be simple: take a bunch of loans tie them up in one neat package and sell pieces of the package to investors.
1	the slightly higher returns aren't enough to compensate for the extra risk	that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate
1	a lot of this stuff really is in untested waters	we don't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn
1	this is the heyday of debt	before the sun sets on the '80s it seems nothing will be left unhocked

1	the triple-a-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year treasury issues	on a $10 000 investment that's a difference of only $50 a year
1	but mr. powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts such as retirement plans	that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts
1	but skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper	when you buy an asset-backed issue you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties
1	some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets	at a time when americans are leveraged to their eyeballs asset-backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times
1	at the very least a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find -- that is treasurys	that could widen the yield spread between treasurys and asset-backed securities as well as make it tougher to unload the latter
1	some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues	for one thing credit-card loans are unsecured

1	that the current regime is already communist as are its vietnamese overseers back in hanoi as are the khmer rouge -- who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups	it's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government but the one good bet is that the non-communists would disappear
1	that the non-communists would disappear	that would leave hun sen and the khmer rouge
1	the khmer rouge however carry an unsurpassed record for cambodian tyranny	these utopians caused the deaths of well over one million cambodians
1	for the u.s. to lend even the slightest support to the most infamous killers on indochina's bleak scene could only disturb america's allies elsewhere	it would be entirely rational for communist insurgents in countries such as the philippines or peru to conclude the following: fight viciously enough and the u.s. under the banner of pragmatism might eventually help negotiate your way to victory
1	fight viciously enough and the u.s. under the banner of pragmatism might eventually help negotiate your way to victory	u.s. diplomacy has done it before and it will likely do it again
1	why the timidity	at the very least the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the khmer rouge and cambodia's communists from ultimately moving against their opponents.
1	at the very least the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the khmer rouge and cambodia's communists from ultimately moving against their opponents	when that day comes it would be particularly awful to know that the united states sat on military aid and deprived these people of the means to settle their fate with at least a little honor
1	one major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark which began less than a year after merkur's 1985 launch	as the west german currency rose so did merkur prices
1	apparently however the improvement came too late	last fall ford announced it would discontinue the xr4ti in the u.s. at the end of the 1989 model year
1	but the partners didn't believe the market for the systems was developing as rapidly as they had hoped	after reportedly investing $100 million in the business discovision ceased manufacturing operations in 1982 and sold many of its assets to tokyo-based pioneer among others

1	it would never give notice to its customers	the capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations

1	that cbs could run up	those deals can turn sour if the numbers don't work
1	cbs is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them	the potential bill: more than $600 million for several seasons an 80% jump
1	mr. pilson is an unlikely big spender	in the mid-1980s he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices
1	but the 49-year-old mr. pilson is hardly a man to ignore the numbers	a yale law school graduate he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at metromedia inc. and the william morris talent agency.
1	it's also a fast fix for an ailing image	flashy sports as the only way the last-place network can cut through the clutter of cable and vcrs grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows premiering a few weeks later
1	that isn't surprising	regular tv series ratings have slumped in the past five years and premiering new shows is a crap shoot
1	that will please once-grumpy affiliates -- another aim of the pilson plan	they gleefully await the dream season in 1990

1	the cbs plan to use big-time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success however	no amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak
1	in this market of 40 channels sophisticated viewers and the remote control trial isn't a guarantee of anything	if the show ain't a killer they're gone
1	even the boon to affiliate relations may be limited	the sports lineup may add only 1% to 5% to a station's annual profits
1	the sports lineup may add only 1% to 5% to a station's annual profits	it alone isn't likely to stop a station from dumping cbs shows
1	and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events	all prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time differences with norway so the results can be announced on the 6 o'clock news
1	that even if cbs loses say $10 million it matters little	ten million ain't jack man when you got $3 billion sitting in the bank
1	moreover sports has claimed its place as a guaranteed ratings-getter	this isn't outlandish bidding
1	this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it	i would tend to trust their judgment
1	that's easy for him to say	cbs's four-year nba pact now at $176 million for four years could double in price by the time his talks with mr. pilson are completed later this month

1	although sports officials predict jumps of 50% to 100% in the major contracts coming up for renewal ad rates may rise only 20%	cbs hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time

1	it also reflects the broader pressure on companies in europe to keep up as the european community prepares to reduce internal trade barriers by 1992	the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate
1	the acquisition would give paribas fresh diversity bringing it properties in food and transport where it has been weak	navigation mixte has investments in a sugar company a food and canning concern a bakery and bus and trucking firms among others

1	lloyd's once a pillar of the world insurance market is being shaken to its very foundation	the 301-year-old exchange is battered by enormous claims from a decade-long run of unprecedented disasters
1	at the same time lloyd's is besieged by disgruntled investors and hamstrung by inefficient but time-honored ways of conducting business	the exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow less-profitable segments of the market by less hidebound competitors
1	lloyd's is on the ropes	it needs more discipline
1	many of the 31 329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange's most basic tenets the concept of unlimited personal liability	investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe
1	during the five-year period ended 1986 roughly 80% of the names had money tied up in money-losing syndicates according to chatset consultants	the peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number of them now
1	i can't think of any reason to join lloyd's now	the downside is very considerable and at the moment the upside is very marginal
1	the downside is very considerable and at the moment the upside is very marginal	if profits don't improve he may quit the exchange
1	today lloyd's share of the world market excluding life insurance is about 2%. (its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included	bigger rivals such as aetna and allianz backed by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates
1	thus lloyd's can't react quickly to competition	lloyd's has lost control of the situation
1	by that he means low-margin but low-risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance	the exchange must find new products and new markets
1	that won't be an easy task	tradition is dictator at lloyd's
1	he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as 50% the premiums they should have charged for property risks from 1980 to 1985	how unprofessional we must have appeared to the outside world -- how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation
1	the departures of names isn't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity currently about #11 billion	the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names
1	though lloyd's has talked for years about computerizing underwriting transactions the effort hasn't gotten very far	competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information
1	competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information	both groups cling to traditional face-to-face dealings even for routine policies
1	but such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters brokers and administrators before being implemented	the proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand
1	the exchange is updating some procedures to make speedier payments on claims	by next year all underwriters will be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper work on claims
1	the results which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of flat-to-lower earnings for the big electronics retailer disappointed analysts and traders	tandy's stock fell $1.375 a share to close at $44 in new york stock exchange composite trading

1	the situation will be especially delicate for mr. kimbrough	he takes over a school system in the midst of radical reform
1	a school system in the midst of radical reform	chicagoans have just elected 540 neophyte school boards one for each school

1	it's a case of the market being too high to buy and too afraid to sell	it's better to wait
1	unfavorable foreign-exchange rates and a lower tax rate	earnings for the group declined to $11 million from $33 million last year
1	if that money were being taxed it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen	in 1984 an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions
1	everyone is extremely convinced the economy is slowing	if we're not headed for a recession we're certainly headed for a major slowdown
1	with due respect to highly classified correspondence and other buzzwords the leakers are performing a public service	if the cia has become a protection service for mr. noriega the american people ought to know
1	mr. noriega didn't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol	maybe we need a cia version of the miranda warning: you have the right to conceal your coup intentions because we may rat on you
1	in other words congress won't let the cia do much of anything anymore and that's fine with the cia	the pay's the same and the duty's lighter
1	no doubt many people in the cia the pentagon and the national security council have read it	what kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who've read all this and know what can happen if they fail
1	the order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set a product of the 1970s vietnam syndrome against any executive action	president bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend america's national security
1	president bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend america's national security	there are of course good reasons the u.s. shouldn't get into the assassination business but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the u.s. should start passing out exploding cigars
1	but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the u.s. should start passing out exploding cigars	the world being the nasty place it is we want presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed
1	the world being the nasty place it is we want presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed	in such situations you cannot write rules in advance you can only make sure the president takes the responsibility
1	amid the market disorder even drexel which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors is pulling in its horns	although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults withdrawn new offerings redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors
1	that the market is troubled but still viable and appropriately enough quite quality-conscious	nobody's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years
1	what has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden realization that junk bonds cannot necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds	unlike the new york stock exchange where buyers and sellers are quickly matched the junk market where risky corporate loans are traded is sometimes closed for repairs
1	we certainly do have a lack of liquidity here and it's something to be concerned about	i have no reason to think things will get worse but this market has a knack for surprising us
1	and the risks aren't appropriate for us	the big insurer unlike prudential owns only about $150 million of publicly sold junk bonds
1	i have no regrets about going forward	we are the golden state and there is a certain amount of jealousy
1	everybody appreciates that it is a national disaster and that we've got to address it	i would hope very much that we wouldn't end up in a kind of situation where you have a bidding war and then a veto threat
1	no single influence was greater than mr. whitten	a master of pork-barrel politics he had crafted the $2.85 billion package in vintage style and used the full force of his chairmanship to keep the proposal intact and dismiss any alternative
1	a member in the house leadership and skilled legislator mr. fazio nonetheless found himself burdened not only by california's needs but by hurricane hugo amendments he accepted in a vain effort to build support in the panel	the california democrat appeared embarrassed by provisions inserted on behalf of owners of private beaches in the virgin islands and lumber interests sought to add another $100 million in federal aid to plant timber on private land in north and south carolina

1	now that's advice the writers should take to heart	they have a series with a good character some interesting even occasionally surprising plot lines and they're ruining it

1	the selling that started on friday continued yesterday	the december contract fell 3.85 cents a pound to $1.1960
1	some traders were thought to be waiting for the auto sales report which will be released today	such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile catalytic converters
1	because many traders have already been badly burnt by such stories	the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again
1	also weighing on both metals' prices is the role of the chief supplier the soviet union	that the soviets' thirst for dollars this year to buy grain and other western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very much
1	the december contract rose $33 a metric ton to $1 027 near its high for the day	that the 1989-90 world cocoa surplus would be 231 000 tons down from 314 000 tons for the previous year
1	tana which holds properties in 17 oil and gas fields in south texas will provide texaco with mostly gas reserves	the fields contain recoverable reserves of 435 billion cubic feet of natural gas and four million barrels of oil

1	in the year-earlier period the maker of diesel engines and parts had a narrower deficit of $17.6 million or $1.84 a share with sales of $808.3 million	shipments of truck engines which provide a higher margin than most of the company's other products declined 16% from a year earlier

1	labor problems are the last thing mr. smith needs right now	although the tiger acquisition has brought federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be it also has brought problems
1	there's a certain irony in the fact that federal express faces its first union problems as a result of its tiger purchase	tiger itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen who had airlifted supplies over the hump from india to china during world war ii
1	for now the union issue is the most nettlesome of federal's tiger problems	although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers mr. smith doesn't countenance what he considers insubordination
1	that sort of approach however hasn't worked since the addition of tiger	its 6 500 workers who had battled tiger's management for years over givebacks were union members until the day of the merger when most of their unions were automatically decertified
1	mr. smith angered federal's pilots too	in his haste to seal the deal with tiger chairman saul steinberg last august mr. smith ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago: that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be end-tailed -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules pay and career options
1	already the fight has been costly	the seniority-list controversy along with the job-classification dispute has been turned over to the mediator

1	even before then the trust may be eager to unload manville stock	it doesn't pay a dividend and this trust needs income
1	moreover with 88% of its assets tied up in manville the trust is badly in need of diversification	obviously a diversified portfolio would have less risk

1	the intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly {maidenform} is a force to be reckoned with	although working women are forced to wear the uniform of the day to retain their femininity they are buying better quality more upscale intimate apparel
1	it is fun competing as a private company	you can think long range
1	the company could command a good price in the market	over the past three and a half years apparel companies many of whom have strong brand names have been bought at about 60% of sales
1	while the company has always been family-run mr. brawer isn't the first person to marry into the family and subsequently head maidenform	mrs. coleman's husband joseph a physician succeeded mrs. rosenthal as president and served in that post until his death in 1968

1	if mr. dozen has a weakness it may be his golf game	he digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball like a farmer
1	bond investors have been watching stocks closely	when you get a big sell-off in equities money starts to shift into bonds

1	the issue was oversubscribed	it's a segmented market and if you have a good strong credit people have an appetite for it

1	red tape is the bugaboo of small business	ironically the person who wants to run his or her own business is probably the active results-oriented sort most likely to hate meeting the rules and record-keeping demands of federal state and local regulators
1	the red tape they most love to hate is red tape they would also hate to lose	that much of the government meddling that torments them is essential to the public good and even to their own businesses
1	but the ever-changing laws are usually so complicated and confusing that you need professionals to help you	you can't do it yourself
1	complying with these is enough to make business owners look forward to their own pension days	yearly changes in federal benefit laws force small businesses to repeatedly re-evaluate and redesign existing plans
1	to justify their exempt status and avoid penalties these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they didn't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense	you need one person to just take care of sales tax

1	mr. bush has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment that would explicitly give him a line-item veto	that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending

1	speaking of dark nights the met's next-door neighbor the new york city opera has canceled its season after failing to reach a settlement with its musicians who wanted pay parity with the the chicago lyric and san francisco opera orchestras	well they can now go and audition there
1	good luck	common sense suggests that people who play for a company that charges about half what those houses do for a ticket are not in the same market

1	the delicious hegemony won't end anytime soon	new apple trees grow slowly and the red delicious is almost as entrenched as mom
1	but i'm going to lose $50 000 to $60 000 on it	i'm going to have to get another job this year just to eat

1	boston safe deposit's performance has been hurt this year by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities	the mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk and when rates moved unfavorably -- beginning late last year and continuing into this year -- it cost them

1	needless to say he was talking about rico	that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors
1	that justice's prosecutions of drexel burnham lambert michael milken and princeton/newport violated notions of fundamental fairness	justice is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics
1	that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process	prosecutors not to seek forfeitures if there are less intrusive alternatives such as bonds and in any case not to seek forfeitures disproportionate to the defendant's crime
1	these changes come a tad late for princeton/newport the first ricoed securities firm	it was forced into liquidation before trial when investors yanked their funds after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture
1	for the firm the liquidation was sentence first verdict later	prosecutors wanted $23.8 million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $400 000

1	although external events have contributed to the morass the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs	to reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits these programs can provide credit policy must:
1	for example legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector	farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds
1	for example student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that students' future earnings are not accepted as collateral	the program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount
1	borrowers' incentives are equally skewed	since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low
1	since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low.	simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection (taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies) and to deny new credit to defaulters
1	simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection (taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies) and to deny new credit to defaulters	these provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market imperfections
1	loan guarantees don't appear at all until the borrower defaults so new guarantees do not raise the deficit even though they create future liabilities for the government	by converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit
1	by converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit	predictably guarantees outstanding have risen by $130 billion since 1985 while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $30 billion
1	this figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private lenders to forecast losses or determined by selling loans to private owners (without federal guarantees)	neither technique is perfect but both are better than the current system which misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $20 billion annually according to the congressional budget office
1	but both are better than the current system	a budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what congress is committing them to
1	many agencies roll over their debt paying off delinquent loans by issuing new loans or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans	in any case they avoid having to write off the loans
1	the administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits	establishing these practices would permit earlier identification of emerging financial crises provide better information for loan sales and budgeting decisions and reduce fraud
1	next year looks dismal	noting that cray doesn't have a low-end supercomputer to compete with the likes of convex computer corp. and international business machines corp. such a machine would be necessary to get things back on line here
1	p&g's always sanitary napkin sold under the whisper name in japan has firmly established itself as a leading brand	p&g will expand its personal-care product line in japan to continue that momentum
1	some highly publicized cases involving rico tros have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process	in order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected the criminal division has instituted the following requirements to control the use of tros in rico prosecutions
1	in deciding whether forfeiture (and hence a tro) is appropriate the section will consider the nature and severity of the offense	the government's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant's crime
1	ual's decision to remain an independent company sent share prices tumbling	by midmorning the djia had plunged 80 points
1	nevertheless on capitol hill lawmakers said they are worried that financial institutions are routinely discriminating against minorities	they asked regulators to suggest new ways to force banks and thrifts to comply with anti-discrimination laws
1	the combination of a second consecutive decline in monthly durable-goods orders and lackluster mid-october auto sales helped prop up the treasury market	a slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest rates tend to bolster bond prices
1	reports like those yesterday help build the case for lower rates	now bond investors are looking toward next week's report from national purchasing managers and the government's october employment report as potentially prompting the fed to lower rates
1	but as stock prices recovered some of the early losses so did the u.s. currency	the dollar ended down only modestly
1	this year it was the farmers who brought them down	in june farmers held onto meat milk and grain waiting for july's usual state-directed price rises
1	the communists froze prices instead	the farmers ran a boycott
1	on aug. 1 the state tore up its controls and food prices leaped	without buffer stocks inflation exploded
1	but by the time solidarity took office in september the damage was done	shortageflation as economists have come to call it had gone hyper
1	the cost of raising a pig kept bounding ahead of the return for selling one	the farmers stayed angry
1	at dawn on a cool day hundreds travel to the private market in radzymin a town not far from warsaw hauling pigs cattle and sacks of feed that the state's official buyers can't induce them to sell	here they are searching for a higher price
1	they can't buy feed from the state	there isn't enough
1	i sell -- a little	i am waiting
1	at closing time farmers cart out most of what they carted in	a private market like this just isn't big enough to absorb all that business
1	state monopolies will keep on stifling trade free prices or not until something else replaces them	polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement processing and distribution -- plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors pesticides fertilizers and feed
1	the communists spent 40 years working to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here	building them now will require undergirding from the west and removal of political deadwood a job that solidarity has barely started
1	now among communist reformers they are objects of envy	food is the reformer's top priority the key to popular support
1	as the chinese have shown and the soviets are learning family farms thrive where collectives fail	ownership it seems is the best fertilizer
1	on it a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain beef eggs and milk and nine-tenths of its fruit vegetables and potatoes	like the roman catholic church the polish peasant is a pillar of the nation
1	mr pyszkiewicz smiles and his brow furrows	he expected as much
1	the farmer can say the same for coal cement saw blades	in poland only 4% of all investment goes toward making things farmers want
1	yet the state alone sells seeds and machines	when supplies are short it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain
1	i'm on my own land	i don't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do
1	farm income is 15% below the average.	some men stay their best friend a bottle of vodka but two million acres have gone fallow
1	a private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than poland can spare	poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale
1	poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale	solidarity wants it from the west
1	felix siemienas is destroying it now	he packs pork
1	a law went on the books in january that let him smoke bacon without breeding pigs	he cashed in
1	i don't subsidize anyone	everyone around me lives well
1	mr. siemienas is making a fortune	he has bought some trendy western clothes and a green mercedes with an american flag in the window
1	but the meat-processing machines he picked up are 50 years old	i don't want expensive machines
1	i don't want expensive machines	if the situation changes i'll get stuck with them
1	i care very much for this post	eight years i've had it
1	suddenly i am not a comfortable man for solidarity	i have accomplished too much
1	they want to do more	i wish them all the best
1	that it intends to retain at least a 20% stake long term	a 20% stake would allow honeywell to include yamatake earnings in its results
1	the stock received another blow on friday when goldman sachs analyst eric philo advised that investors with short-term horizons should avoid dun & bradstreet stock because it is unlikely to outperform the market	the stock fell 75 cents
1	the stock split four-for-one on oct. 10	mr. miles's newly purchased shares are now worth $1 068 000 based on philip morris's closing price of $44.50
1	john j. crabb sold 4 500 shares for $11.13 each	he received $50 085
1	pegasus gold has been on a lot of recommended lists as a junior growth company stepping into the big leagues	it's a good company and growing
1	it's a good company and growing	there's nothing that would warrant that it be sold
1	tele-communications is hbo's largest customer and the two have a number of other business relationships.	the purchase of the showtime stake is a direct slap in our face
1	but since time's merger with warner communications inc. relations between the two have become strained	each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated
1	orders for military goods usually catapult in september as the pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins oct. 1	while all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations that the adjustment probably didn't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders
1	that means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will	in such an environment a market maker can absorb huge losses
1	the company posted third-quarter earnings of 95 cents a share down from $1.26 a year earlier	that losses from hurricane hugo reduced net income by 32 cents a share in the most recent quarter
1	nevertheless salomon's stock fell $1.125 yesterday to close at $23.25 a share in new york stock exchange composite trading	october wasn't as good as the third quarter
1	the sales are being dragged down by a glut of 1989 vehicles	the earlier use of incentives depleted the market of scavengers for bargain-basement 1989 cars
1	when the trinity repertory theater named anne bogart its artistic director last spring the nation's theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow	ms. bogart an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as rodgers and hammerstein's south pacific is decidedly downtown
1	but beyond this decorative nod to tradition ms. bogart and company head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms gorky's naturalistic drama into something akin to well farce	the director's attempt to force some brechtian distance between her actors and their characters frequently backfires with performances that are unduly mannered
1	cynthia strickland as the long-suffering varvara is a tiresome whiner not the inspirational counterrevolutionary gorky intended	better to look in the corners for performances that inspire or amuse
1	the u.s. defines it as premediated politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine state agents	to meet the u.s. criteria it only listed incidents that involved civilians and occurred inside its pre-1967 borders
1	they are highly uncertain about the veracity of the separate documents leaked to the new york times	the papers refer to terrorist acts to be carried out in the name of a group called the revolutionary eagles
1	use of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations law against white-collar defendants as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars	that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains
1	mr. runkel declined to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants	the impact if there is any will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use {racketeering charges} is made in individual cases by justice department officials in washington
1	the problem is so vast that we need to try innovative solutions -- in small-scale experiments	here are some ideas
1	develop rental agreements with exclusive purchase options for the renter	an occupant will in most every case be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house
1	an occupant will in most every case be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house	in this way the house is not dumped on to a glutted market
1	the critics also lambasted the magazine industry for something executives often are very proud of: the growth in magazine titles during the 1980s	consumer magazines are suffering from what he called niche-itis the increasing number of magazines that target the idosyncratic interests of readers
1	we are being over-magazined	we are constantly faced with deciding which partnerships {with magazines} we can keep
1	the average yield on six-month broker-sold cds rose to 8.29% from 8.05% and on one-year cds the average yield rose to 8.30% from 8.09%	the brokerage firms which negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose cds they sell generally feel they have to offer clients more than they can get on t-bills or from banks and thrifts directly
1	the (cd) market is unsettled right now	it's very easily influenced by changes in the stock market and the junk bond market
1	and he is using the money to help buy a 45-acre horse farm	just imagine how exciting that would be if that's your horse
1	that this isn't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet	it's a big-risk business
1	maybe it's not that simple	for starters racehorse buyers have to remember the basic problem of such ventures: these beasts don't come with warranties

1	the short seller hopes the replacement shares bought later will cost less than those that were sold	short interest can be a bad-expectations barometer for many stocks
1	short selling isn't necessarily bad for the overall market	shorted shares must eventually be replaced through buying
1	without question something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the politburo	the soviet government has recognized it has a credibility problem
1	the u.s. government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there	the pentagon's recently issued soviet military power repeated the sverdlovsk assessment
1	and we certainly do not believe that mr. gorbachev or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the west take their word for it	sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself
1	but others think property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state's earthquake relief tab	since the late 1970s california property owners have benefited from a tax rollback as a result of a state ballot initiative known as proposition 13
1	but don't bet that contractors' unreported income will be detected that way	that 50% of irs audits don't spot companies that fail to file the reports
1	a claim by peter testa of new york that a stranger paid him $500 to go into a bank and change $44 400 in small bills into large bills is unconvincing the tax court found	it held that testa is taxable on $44 400 of unreported income

1	now only god exists as a matter of absolute necessity	it is built into his nature
1	but since the time of darwin we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species	aren't we after all the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called evolution
1	such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man who discovered the burgess shale one charles doolittle walcott	the received darwinian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species
1	consequently the winnowing process was like a lottery in which each group {held} a ticket unrelated to its anatomical virtues	so much for survival of the fittest
1	mr. gould finds this oddly exhilarating	like an existentialist of old he views our contingency as a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility
1	the universe is a big place and given the right conditions sympathetic to creating some form of life	surely at some other cosmic address a gouldoid creature would have risen out of the ooze to explain why paleontologically speaking it is indeed a wonderful life
1	sears faces an especially daunting challenge on the eve of the christmas shopping season	everyday pricing in the current environment doesn't work

1	the british conglomerate planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a #13.35 billion ($21.03 billion) takeover bid by anglo-french financier sir james goldsmith intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its value-boosting measures	if anything the gyrations in world stock markets since last friday's sharp wall street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring

1	amr's earnings decline comes a year after the parent company of american airlines and the rest of the airline industry set profit records	some analysts say the latest results only seem pale by comparison with a spectacular second half of 1988
1	still amr's stumble doesn't bode well for the rest of the industry	the fort worth texas company is generally regarded as one of the best-run in the business
1	the business turned faster than expected	costs are giving them a little bit of trouble and the whole industry is having a pricing problem
1	the most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as general re corp. which rose $2.75 to $86.50 nac re corp. up $2 to $37.75 american international group inc. up $3.25 to $102.625 and cigna corp. up 87.5 cents to $62.50	insurers will use the earthquake as an excuse to raise insurance rates ending their long price wars
1	pacific telesis group lost 62.5 cents to $44.625	a computer failure delayed its earnings announcement and some investors think it might have extra costs to repair damaged telephone lines
1	cracking the top 10 within three years will be difficult at best	della femina had billings of just $660 million last year and ranked as the u.s.'s 24th-largest ad agency
1	the merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than $2.6 billion -- most of that in europe -- bringing it to about 14th world-wide	to make it to top-10 status it would have to leapfrog over such formidable forces as grey advertising d'arcy masius benton & bowles and omnicom's ddb needham
1	late yesterday afternoon ddb needham executives were scrambling to figure out what to do about a new business presentation that had been scheduled for today	ddb needham's office building may have sustained structural damage

1	the gentlelady is making an important statement	the implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there's something wrong is most unfortunate
1	decent life in the inner cities won't be restored unless the government reclaims the streets from the drug gangs	until then the billions hud spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted
1	wall street is seething over the rules	the provisions could further cool the takeover boom that has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the 1980s
1	you see these in just about every lbo	it becomes a source of cash for the company making the lbo because it gets a deduction and doesn't have to repay the debt for several years
1	but that rule is being virtually overlooked by wall street which is concentrating on coping with the deduction issue	prices for lbos have to come down if you don't have that feature
1	one possible solution for wall street is to increase the equity part of the transaction -- that is give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving company rather than just interest payments	that would force the buy-out firm and the target company's management to reduce their level of ownership
1	another solution is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount	they wouldn't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its deductibility
1	there's no question it will make lbos more expensive	the interest deduction was the engine that made these things more productive
1	the move by ibm wasn't exactly a surprise	the company has spent some $5 billion over the past 3 1/2 years to buy back 42 million common shares or roughly 7% of those outstanding
1	in the short term the move is likely to have little effect	at yesterday's closing price $1 billion would buy back about 10 million shares or less than 2% of the roughly 580 million outstanding
1	the unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry's desire not to have its credibility tarnished by potentially widespread trading defaults on monday	the cboe american stock exchange options clearing corp. and stephen fossett owner of fossett joined in putting up $50 million to guarantee the accounts at first options

1	nearly all the network's computer switches which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another changed to battery power when the city lost power	the battery packs have enough power for only three hours but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel
1	that's because the widely used fiber-optic cable has been installed underground with 25 extra feet of cable between junction points	the slack absorbs the pulling strain generated by an earthquake
1	the economic dislocation was as abrupt as the earthquake itself as virtually all businesses shut down	the $125-billion-a-year bay area economy represents one-fourth of the economy of the nation's most populous state and accounts for 2% to 3% of the nation's total output of goods and services according to the center for continuing study of the california economy in palo alto
1	this has been a major disruption for the bay area economy	obviously things are going to have to go on hold for many companies
1	the damage to the bay area's roadways could cause significant economic hardship	a quarter of a million people cross the bay bridge every day
1	they nevertheless don't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the bay area	all major roadways except interstate 880 and the bay bridge were open by 1 p.m. yesterday
1	officials expect difficulty routing traffic through downtown san francisco	the earthquake caused many streets to buckle and crack making them impassible
1	an operation that it handled smoothly tuesday night after the quake	the volume we received from the banks was a lot lower than usual
1	the volume we received from the banks was a lot lower than usual	a disaster-contingency plan in which the los angeles fed would come to san francisco's aid wasn't needed
1	it's something likely to be spread out over a long period of time	there will be a lot of repair work that won't require the quantities of cement or concrete that new constructon would
1	the earthquake is likely to reduce gnp negligibly in the near term	the first effects are of course negative as work is disrupted and people lose income and cut spending
1	many of the lost tourism dollars won't be recovered	many trips delayed never take place
1	you certainly can say it's going to be extremely severe	we really are talking about shutting down a major american city for a number of days maybe for a few weeks
1	with stocks not a major focus we're waiting for the next guiding light	if the stock market tremors are behind us then the bond market will go back to looking at the next batch of economic numbers to determine where interest rates are heading
1	this is a market that required some level of security	it did not make sense to offer unsecured paper in an unsettling market
1	we're being bombarded by new treasury and agency debt offerings	the market is concerned about its ability to underwrite all this debt at current levels

1	northrop's interest expense also soared to $35 million from $17 million a year ago	debt remained at the $1.22 billion that has prevailed since early 1989 although that compared with $911 million at sept. 30 1988
1	at the same time the market is smaller than the market for ibm-compatible software	for one thing digital maynard mass. has sold fewer machines
1	getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after hurricane hugo ripped through the caribbean and the carolinas last month	the earthquake's toll including possible deep structural damage goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane
1	this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace	his firm along with some others issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday
1	there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this	some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by hurricane hugo
1	it lost its bid to supply software services to the national aeronautics and space administration's ames research center at moffett field calif	nasa selected another bidder for final negotiations
1	the decision which affects millions of dollars of trading positions was made late yesterday because the pacific exchange's options floor was shut down as a result of tuesday's earthquake	it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow
1	the most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading	the pacific exchange has options for 129 underlying stock issues including highly active hilton hotels corp. which is listed on the big board
1	while the exchange's equities floor in san francisco remained open on a limited basis orders were being routed and executed in los angeles	workers could dial out but they couldn't receive telephone calls

1	the big board's disclosure of program trading activity on these two days was unusual	though it collects such data daily its monthly reports on program trading usually come out about three weeks after each month ends
1	and until last friday it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off	some of those folks were coming back
1	then came the frightening 190-point plunge in the dow jones industrial average and a new wave of stock-market volatility	all of a sudden it was back to square one
1	but these wide swings scare them to death. all of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as shearson and merrill lynch & co. that have big retail or individual-investor businesses	after expanding rapidly during the bull-market years up to the 1987 crash retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead
1	that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market	investors will develop thicker skins and their confidence will return
1	meanwhile painewebber remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving wall street their money	it's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets rather than push the investor to move into (specific) products such as equities

1	the result is that instead of the pentagon's proposed split of 60-40 between domestic and foreign bases the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately 70-30	the extra margin for bases in the u.s. enhances the power of the appropriations committees
1	but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere	appropriations committees have used an assortment of devices to disguise as much as $1 billion in spending
1	the bill's managers face criticism too for the unusual number of conditions openly imposed on where funds will be spent	conservatives embarrassed by republican influence-peddling scandals at the department of housing and urban development have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a democratic-controlled congress
1	conservatives embarrassed by republican influence-peddling scandals at the department of housing and urban development have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a democratic-controlled congress	hud secretary jack kemp backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language last week

1	it would be a great tool for curbing the budget deficit and slicing the lard out of government programs	he wants it now
1	not so fast	i consider it one of the stupidest ideas of the 20th century
1	president bush badly wants a line-item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president	that he might not rely on congress to pass the line-item veto law he seeks
1	although that may sound like an arcane maneuver of little interest outside washington it would set off a political earthquake	the ramifications are enormous
1	the ramifications are enormous	it's a real face-to-face arm wrestling challenge to congress
1	and for that reason the president may back down from launching a test case this year	some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a budget-reduction bill looming mr. bush already has enough pending confrontations with congress
1	some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a budget-reduction bill looming mr. bush already has enough pending confrontations with congress	they prefer to put off the line-item veto until at least next year
1	that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process	that a president needs the ability to surgically remove pork-barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills
1	that a president needs the ability to surgically remove pork-barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills	those bills can't easily be vetoed in their entirety because they often are needed to keep the government operating
1	and that it would quickly make its way to the supreme court to be ultimately resolved	it's a major issue and they wouldn't want to leave it at a lower level
1	a line-item veto would expand a president's powers far beyond anything the framers of the constitution had in mind	it puts this president in the legislative business
1	but there may be another problem with the device: despite all the political angst it would cause it mightn't be effective in cutting the deficit	big chunks of the government budget like the entitlement programs of social security and medicare wouldn't be affected
1	that the veto would have what mr. glazier calls an important chilling effect on all manner of appropriations bills	lawmakers would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later
1	whatever the outcome of a test case president bush would have to move cautiously becase the very attempt would antagonize not just democrats but republicans	republicans have as much interest as democrats in the way the system works
1	that it's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person	conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now may regret it later
1	by the end of the 1990s we want to be producing roughly two vehicles overseas for every vehicle that we export from japan	that will involve a substantial increase in overseas manufacturing capacity
1	i'll always be with you jack	don't worry
1	who isn't new to the character	he was mr. hoffman in a 1979 los angeles production of a play called the chicago conspiracy trial
1	television news of course has always been part show-biz	broadcasters have a healthy appreciation of the role entertainment values play in captivating an audience
1	cbs news is also re-enacting the 1979 three mile island nuclear accident in middletown pa. with something less than a cast of thousands	it is combing the town of 10 000 for about 200 extras
1	it is combing the town of 10 000 for about 200 extras	on oct. 20 the town's mayor robert reid made an announcement on behalf of cbs during half-time at the middletown high school football game asking for volunteers
1	no way	i think re-enactments stink
1	this is dangerous and misrepresents abbie's life	it's a sensational piece about someone who is not here to defend himself
1	that dramatization makes the truth flexible	it takes one person's account and gives it authenticity
1	he was concerned at first that the script would misrepresent an astute political mind one that i admired but that his concerns were allayed	the producers did a good job of depicting someone who had done so much but who was also a manic-depressive
1	on the morning of the crash he had been put on notice that an audit committee was recommending his dismissal because of invoicing irregularities in a company audit	investigators have been trying to determine whether the crash was an accident sabotage or suicide
1	dennis farney's oct. 13 page-one article river of despair about the poverty along the mississippi fanned childhood memories of when my parents were sharecroppers in southeastern arkansas only a few miles from the river	although we were white the same economic factors affected us as affects the black people mr. farney writes about
1	your story is an insult to the citizens of the mississippi delta	many of the problems you presented exist in every part of this country
1	overall demand still is very respectable	the outlook is positive for the intermediate to long term
1	but sales of north american-made 1990-model cars are running at an annual rate of only six million down from 7.1 million a year earlier.	auto makers who began deferring some equipment purchases last spring can be expected to remain cautious about spending if their sales don't pick up
1	that recent developments in eastern europe will expand markets for u.s.-made machine tools in that region	there is demand for state-of-the-art machine tools in the soviet union and in other eastern european countries as those nations strive to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as well as the quality of their goods

1	while wall street's tough times and lower u.s. interest rates continue to undermine the dollar weakness in the pound and the yen is expected to offset those factors	by default the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days
1	by default the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days	we're close to the bottom of the near-term ranges
1	with the stock market wobbly and dollar buyers discouraged by signs of u.s. economic weakness and the recent decline in u.s. interest rates that has diminished the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments traders say the dollar is still in a precarious position	they'll be looking at levels to sell the dollar
1	predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound's weak state after mr. lawson's resignation and the yen's inability to strengthen substantially when there are dollar retreats	with the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies you don't have a confirmation that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works
1	these rate indications aren't directly comparable	lending practices vary widely by location
1	strategy however is about possibilities not hopes and dreams	by ignoring costs u.s. strategists abdicate their responsibility for hard decisions
1	step 1 cleans up our books	our five-year plan contains three accounting devices -- negative money an above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates -- which understate the spending the pentagon has committed itself to by almost $100 billion
1	that plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $45 billion	to make the books balance as is required by law somebody invented a new budget line item that simply subtracted $45 billion
1	it freezes the budget at its current level and forces the pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until 1994	this reduces the baseline by $229 billion
1	scenario 2 extends the recent compromises between the house and the senate; it splits the difference between scenarios 1 and 3 by increasing the budget at 2% per year	it reduces the baseline by $169 billion
1	if for example they choose to keep the b-2 stealth bomber they would have to sacrifice more and more other programs -- such as carrier battlegroups or army divisions -- as they moved toward lower budget levels	these trade-offs would evolve priorities by revealing when the cost of the b-2 became prohibitive
1	a strategic review is fundamentally different	it would be run by the joint chiefs under simple directions: produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the secretary of defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used to achieve u.s. goals
1	but in the end it must be rejected for logical as well as moral reasons	to say that the pentagon should act irresponsibly because acting responsibly will provoke congress into acting irresponsibly leads to the conclusion that the pentagon should deliberately exaggerate its needs in the national interest
1	it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between unpleasant or imperfect alternatives	if we want meaningful priorities we must understand the trade-offs they imply before we make commitments
1	in an effort to stave off a plan that would require all lawyers in new york state to provide twenty hours of free legal aid a year the state bar recommended an alternative program to increase voluntary participation in pro bono programs	the state bar association's policy making body the house of delegate voted saturday to ask chief judge sol wachtler to give the bar's voluntary program three years to prove its effectiveness before considering mandatory pro bono
1	the state bar association's policy making body the house of delegate voted saturday to ask chief judge sol wachtler to give the bar's voluntary program three years to prove its effectiveness before considering mandatory pro bono	we believe our suggested plan is more likely to improve the availability of quality legal service to the poor than is the proposed mandatory pro bono plan and will achieve that objective without the divisiveness distraction administrative burdens and possible failure that we fear would accompany an attempt to impose a mandatory plan
1	most national council members are themselves disabled or are parents of children with disabilities	we know firsthand the discrimination addressed by the act: to be told there's no place for your child in school; to spend lonely hours at home because there is no transportation for someone in a wheelchair; to be denied employment because you are disabled
1	businessmen took their cue from the engineers	when congress finally passed the metric conversion act in 1975 industry was far ahead
1	the pentagon has led the charge particularly as military alliances spread world-wide	new weapons systems will be around until the next century
1	what is driving dentsu's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its japanese clients as they grow in the u.s. and europe	if we don't do something . . . we won't be able to catch up with demand
1	but success overseas in unfamiliar markets could be trickier than for other industries such as manufacturers	on its own dentsu's muscle in japan may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking non-japanese clients

1	sales rose despite the adverse effect of japan's unpopular consumption tax introduced in april	increasing personal spending and capital investment are fueling growth
1	but investors looking for alternatives aren't finding it easy	yields on most fixed-income securities are lower than several months ago
1	a mix of cds and other holdings may make the most sense	people should remember their money isn't all or nothing -- they don't need to be shopping for the one interest-rate-type investment and putting all their money in it
1	investors with a heavy tax load should take out their calculators	yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on cds for maturities of perhaps one to five years
1	some of the more cautious cd holders might like pre-refunded municipals	these securities get top credit ratings
1	but they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead	bond resale prices and thus fund share prices move in the opposite direction from rates
1	to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present when rates seem headed down	with average maturities of a month or so money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates with a slight lag
1	try combining a money fund and an intermediate-term bond fund as a low-risk bet on falling rates	if rates unexpectedly rise the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower-than-expected return from the bond fund
1	despite the inevitable comparison with compaq however texas instruments' new notebook won't be a direct competitor	while compaq sells its machines to businesses through computer retailers texas instruments will be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to value-added resellers and original-equipment manufacturers

1	other firms are dealing with the masses	they have the culture to adequately service high-net-worth individuals
1	the recent bids for united and american airlines have led congress to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements	the house is scheduled to vote today on an anti-airline-takeover bill that would block for up to 50 days any bid for 15% or more of a u.s. airline even a straight cash purchase
1	rep. edward markey (d. mass.) chairman of the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb turmoil in the marketplace	that program-trading by roughly 15 big institutions is pushing around the markets and scaring individual investors
1	one would force brokerage houses to provide the sec detailed information about loans made by their holding companies	such loans often are used to finance leveraged buy-outs and the agency is worried that a sharp market drop could create capital problems for the firms
1	to require large traders to report transactions on a systematic basis	that information is critical to reconstructing sharp market moves such as the one nearly two weeks ago
1	current demand for used aircraft is strong	that pwa would have little difficulty attracting prospective buyers
1	yesterday's sluggish action was in marked contrast to the rearing and plunging of stock prices tuesday after the proposed buy-out of ual corp. once again collapsed	the stock market's lurching moves have prompted many investors to head for the sidelines until it regains some semblance of stability
1	action also was much slower yesterday in the treasury market	bond investors paid close attention to comments by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan
1	it's time to take a fresh look at the nation's central bank	after 75 years there may be a few things that are worth reexamining
1	nicholas brady the incumbent treasury secretary is of course aware of the proposal and he doesn't like it much	mr. dorgen has changed tactics dropping the seat-for-the-secretary idea
1	but so far federal reserve chairman alan greenspan hasn't made a pitch for the job	the fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well
1	now sterilized intervention may have some effect	when traders see the fed is in the exchange market it may make them tread a little carefully for fear of what the central bank may do
1	richard breeden hadn't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone	it was after all only his second full day as chairman of the securities and exchange commission
1	but the lack of lines became painfully apparent	as the stock market lurched into a 190-point free fall on oct. 13 mr. breeden found himself scurrying around the sixth floor of the sec -- from his desk where the new york stock exchange was on an open line to his assistant's office where the commodity futures trading commission was connected to a third room where a computer monitored market moves
1	it won't happen again	now there are more lines connected to the chairman's office and the market-monitoring computer has been moved next to his desk
1	also unlike mr. ruder mr. breeden appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda	as a former white house aide who worked closely with congress he is savvy in the ways of washington
1	for instance he hasn't stated a clear position on high-risk high-yield junk bonds an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market spills over into stocks	he may be waiting to see the results of several pending sec studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules
1	congress seems likely to let the new chairman have his way for a while	members of the senate banking committee know mr. breeden from working on the thrift-bailout bill and the relationship generally remains warm
1	these days mr. breeden is winning praise in washington and on wall street for his behind-the-scenes role in monitoring the friday-the-13th market plunge and the following monday's harrowing morning session	as a regulator charged with restoring investor confidence mr. breeden avoided making market-jarring comments and worked to gather information critical to wall street and to other government agencies
1	not everyone has jumped on the breeden bandwagon however	some in washington contend that it's too soon to tell whether mr. breeden will help or hinder the sec
1	some in washington contend that it's too soon to tell whether mr. breeden will help or hinder the sec	i don't think this was a real test it was a fairly stressful weekend but my sense is if you hadn't had richard breeden there it wouldn't have made much of a difference
1	i don't think this was a real test	it was a fairly stressful weekend but my sense is if you hadn't had richard breeden there it wouldn't have made much of a difference
1	an agency that covets its independence mr. breeden may be too much of a washington insider	that he has adorned his office with five photos of george bush one of them featuring the first dog millie
1	that he has adorned his office with five photos of george bush one of them featuring the first dog millie	they worry that mr. breeden also will roll over when told to do so by the white house
1	during the monday market rebound a new york exchange spokesman told cable news network viewers that the industrial average had turned down 70 points	stunned mr. breeden turned to his market-monitoring computer which by then was next to his desk
1	that a widely watched stock-market service quotron had miscalculated the industrial average	mr. breeden instructed sec staffers to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number

1	the former $3 million-a-year lobbyist now frequents shelters for the homeless and devotes a third of his time counseling other recovering alcoholics	i feel better than i ever have in my life
1	and one of the worst sins in washington is to be laughed at	you can be wicked but not foolish
1	former rep. robert bauman a maryland republican who lost his seat in 1980 after he was caught soliciting sex from a 16-year-old boy has never regained his professional footing as a lawyer	he was deserted by the right wing
1	but not to enable him to directly lobby	that would require him to disclose his clients by registering as a lobbyist
1	raymond donovan the new jersey construction executive who was forced to resign as labor secretary and indicted in 1985 only to be acquitted of fraud charges often calls other scandal-tossed public figures to offer a sympathetic ear	each time a new scandal hits it pulls the scabs off your knees
1	many junkholders had been hoping that kkr and mr. gillett would invest new money in sci tv	those investors think sci tv needs new equity to survive
1	in 1972 then treasury secretary george shultz with the key support of sen. carl curtis sought some form of pensions for the uncovered	that year a four-man group headed by william lieber in the legislation and regulations division of the office of the chief counsel for the internal revenue service was assigned the task of designing a plan

1	several months ago it also added black health and beauty aids displays to many stores	we certainly see an increasing trend toward that
1	further i think mr. knight made a poor choice in picking a fish called wanda as an example of the deplorable state of modern comedy movies	the specific scene he mentions in which pet dogs are crushed is somewhat reminiscent of the continual plights that befall the coyote in the old warner bros. road runner cartoons
1	that's really where the leverage hurt	share prices performed even worse than the funds' asset values
1	in a typical leverage strategy a fund tries to capture the spread between what it costs to borrow and the higher return on the bonds it buys with the borrowed money	if the market surges holders can make that much more profit
1	if the market surges holders can make that much more profit	the leverage effectively acts as an interest-free margin account for investors
1	some have raised their cash positions to record levels	high cash positions help buffer a fund when the market falls
1	prospect street high income portfolio for instance now holds about 15% in cash and equivalents nearly quintuple the amount it held earlier this year	the fund which is 40% leveraged has maintained a substantial cushion between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio's bonds
1	the fund which is 40% leveraged has maintained a substantial cushion between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio's bonds	i don't want to be in a position to have to sell
1	that's a problem because cash isn't earning us very much money	this is the most difficult market that i've been involved in
1	we're looking at the leverage factor every day	at some point if we are unable to cover our leveraged cost we're going to have to make a move
1	parenthood this summer's successful and amusing movie about parents and children apparently was only the beginning	it seems that every day a new movie opens featuring a child coping with a mother's death or adoption or aging parents or pregnancy

1	that integrating 110 million eastern europeans with 320 million western europeans is primarily the task of europeans despite the u.s.'s obvious strategic and economic interest	the u.s. tends to look at eastern europe {not including the soviet union} as europe looks at latin america: important but far away.
1	a reintegrated europe implies big changes in 40-year-old military and economic policies	there is likely to be a natural division of labor with the u.s. more engaged in strategic issues with the soviet union and western europe more involved with specific aid measures for the east
1	in part this division is dictated by economics	west germany is a net exporter of capital while the u.s. isn't
1	there seems to be a message from moscow there's a deal on offer they want reassurance we won't try to undermine or destroy the warsaw pact. . . . in return the u.k. and france could keep their nuclear weapons	once both sides feel comfortable it should be that much easier to make more progress toward the economic and social reforms that are now starting in the east

1	city fathers have managed to push through projects that are crucial for tourist growth such as the expansion of mccarran international airport to accommodate the 44% of las vegas tourists who fly here	this year by one means of transport or another more than 18 million people will visit the city
1	the expansion will set off a marketing war among the big hotel-casinos	las vegas promises or threatens to become a giant carnival with rooms to be had for $45 a day or less for visitors uninspired solely by gambling
1	the mirage will cost at least $1 million a day to operate	but some securities analysts doubt it
1	only now is it undergoing a badly needed facelift	its parking lot is inconvenient the mgm lion's-head logo still appears in places and customers still call it the grand rather than the bally grand
1	any hotel-casino without a strong identity will get whacked by the new competition	if you don't know what you are bigger won't make you better but it'll sure make you poorer
1	the company's excalibur will also appeal to families of course	its castle will be the most compelling piece of folk architecture ever built
1	instead they are spending to reinforce the identity that they believe attracts their customers	more rooms aren't the answer for us
1	other smaller concerns are also pursuing market niches -- hawaiian tourists for example or the local trade	there's still room for boutique properties
1	there's still room for boutique properties	off the strip marcor is building the rio a hotel-casino with a brazilian theme and only 430 rooms -- all of them suites
1	but 93% of tourists still come for gambling	we can't lose sight of that

1	leading the gains for du pont in the latest quarter was its industrial products segment	the company benefited from continued strong demand and higher selling prices for titanium dioxide a white pigment used in paints paper and plastics
1	in the diversifed businesses segment which includes herbicides profit grew to $64 million from $27 million	thus increasing sales in the third quarter
1	when it owns stocks renaissance's portfolio typically is composed of about 60 large-capitalization issues	to make buy or sell moves the firm solicits wall street brokerage houses a day or so in advance looking for the best package price to carry out the trades
1	the dow average now stands more than 20% higher while renaissance's portfolio of treasurys produced a return of about 6% through the first three quarters of the year	the computer's miscalculation has been painful for renaissance
1	our {computer} model has a certain trigger point	when the computer says switch renaissance switches
1	but the plan now is being reformulated	the whole structure has changed
1	the success of the british gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law rather than the choice of gold for valuing the currency	it is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914 when the bank of england was an independent private bank the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended but with the subsequent nationalization of the bank of england the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined
1	legal controversies in america have a way of assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case	they speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment
1	it is what lawyers call fact intensive	it presents no great issue of legal principle no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt
1	instead it turns on the disputed and elusive facts of who did what to whom	it is difficult if not impossible for anyone who has not pored over the thousands of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy
1	a second theme is the undercurrent of social class and race in the public reaction to the morgan case	dr. morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the best schools
1	finally the case of dr. morgan gave congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the district of columbia government	the local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons
1	the local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons	bashing the d.c. government is risk-free for members of congress
1	the morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex class race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of dr. morgan's particular situation	it may stand as a metaphor for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence
1	that we had been aiming at the wrong target	president reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election
1	primarily because there's more to the matter than ronald reagan's personal values or lack of them	selling the presidency for a mess of pottage is not so much a devaluation from the norm of public life today as it is a reflection of the disintegration of public standards
1	but there is no defense at all for the ethos of the 1980s	we didn't stampede into it we slithered and slipped down the long slope
1	researchers with business ties are more likely to falsify findings in order to tout new drugs	as ties between academia and venture capital have blossomed in recent years governmental fear of abuse has risen
1	the amira transaction is typical of the way venture-capital firms are approaching the task of commercializing biotechnology research	while universities develop the basic research venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its commercialization
1	in many of these deals venture capitalists had the inside track	investors were willing to gamble on new technologies because we had exclusive rights to those technologies
1	but under the proposed guidelines all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work	without the exclusivity most venture capitalists won't have the incentive to invest in such deals
1	the proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization -- and force small companies to waste scarce capital	if start-ups can't have early access to research being conducted at institutions we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research
1	that its guidelines should not stifle research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use	universities such as harvard and mit should be able to develop a way to act as brokers for the individual scientists
1	many officials are also concerned about companies getting a free ride on government-sponsored research	a congressional subcommitee has been investigating the potential abuse from researchers holding stock in companies exploiting their research
1	it doesn't matter whether they call it guidelines or policy	the damage is already done
1	senate majority leader george mitchell (d. maine) was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds perhaps as soon as today	mr. packwood all but conceded defeat telling mr. mitchell: i sense at this stage you may have the votes
1	i'm probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal	the ira portion (of the packwood-roth plan) is irresponsible
1	today sen. mitchell and other leading democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to bash the proposal	that the richest 100 taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital-gains differential of $13 million each in 1985 the last year for which figures are available
1	that there are numerous other important measures democrats badly wanted passed -- such as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health-care plan for the elderly -- that might provide the president leverage in cutting deals with democrats	a capital-gains tax cut might be paired with such measures to help ensure passage
1	the project could jeopardize costly efforts to stop or slow down the subsidence that makes venice subject to regular and destructive flooding	the council unanimously opposed the idea of agip pumping out the methane gas and swiftly appealed to the company and to prime minister giulio andreotti
1	agip refused to reconsider	it's unlikely extracting the gas will cause subsidence
1	the u.s. proposal also was criticized by food-importing developing countries	while many experts argue that food-importing nations would eventually become self-sufficient in a free-market system the poorest nations are likely to need help in the meantime
1	lower yields are just reflecting lower short-term interest rates	money funds invest in such things as short-term treasury securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit all of which have been posting lower interest rates since last spring
1	the top-performing fund in the latest week was dreyfus worldwide dollar with a seven-day compound yield of 9.45%	the fund invests heavily in dollar-denominated money-market securities overseas
1	while westinghouse hasn't had a nuclear power plant order from a u.s. utility in about a decade excess capacity is beginning to shrink	the company foresees the need for a major boost in new-generation capability throughout the 1990s
1	westinghouse also expects its international sales to soon grow to 25% of total corporate sales from 20% last year	the company is negotiating with the soviets to build a thermo king truck-refrigeration plant that would produce about 10 000 units annually
1	it's a tremendous disappointment	allowing the epa to condone continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema to the environmental community
1	when the epa was harshly criticized for failing to yank the possible carcinogen a growth regulator used to make apples redder and crunchier	the agency has since acted to remove alar from the nation's grocery shelves by may 31 1991 and the apple industry has said that growers already have stopped using the chemical
1	to set negligible risk levels for pesticide residues in processed food	chemicals that exceed these risk levels would be barred but those that fall below these levels would be allowed
1	that its mail rooms there simply stopped delivering it	now thousands of mailers catalogs and sales pitches go straight into the trash
1	motorola is in good company	businesses across the country are getting fed up with junk mail
1	the direct-mail industry not surprisingly is fuming at the injustice of it all	after all this is the industry that has a hard enough time getting any respect that is the butt of so many jokes that television's l.a.
1	why anyone would want to close themselves off {from direct mail} a priori doesn't make any sense	it smacks of big brotherism
1	it smacks of big brotherism	they're going to decide what their employees can or cannot read
1	the practice is however legal in most cases	the postal service's only job is to deliver the mail to the mail room; once it gets there a company can do with it what it wishes
1	the biographer/critic should not be required simply to express . . . conclusions without defending them by example	in such circumstances free-speech interests outweighed the interests of the copyright owner
1	still the salinger decision created a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished materials	that a few of mr. miller's quotations from mr. hubbard's unpublished writings because they were not necessary to prove historical points failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed copyright
1	that laches is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction	had the suit been filed in time bare-faced messiah would have been suppressed
1	this was too much for james oakes the court's chief judge	in a powerful separate opinion judge oakes further distinguished the salinger case by pointing out that a living person like mr. salinger had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man like mr. hubbard
1	that a living person like mr. salinger had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man like mr. hubbard	that salinger might by being taken in another factual context come back to haunt us
1	yet at the moment they are the judges who are making the law	as matters stand the salinger ruling torn from context and broadly construed is controlling
1	as matters stand the salinger ruling torn from context and broadly construed is controlling	if an author quotes more than minimal amounts of unpublished copyrighted materials as the salinger decision had it he deserves to be enjoined. the courts have not defined minimal amounts but publishers i understand take it to mean about 50 words
1	that when a writer uses quotation marks in reporting what someone has said the reader assumes that these are the speaker's precise words or at least his words purged of uh and you know and grammatical error	while judges have an obligation under the first amendment to safeguard freedom of the press the right to deliberately alter quotations is not in my view a concomitant of a free press
1	these were only two of a series of fabrications that had in judge kozinski's words the cumulative effect of making mr. masson appear more arrogant less sensitive shallower more self-aggrandizing and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements	as robert coles wrote in a review of ms. malcolm's book mr. masson emerges as a grandiose egotist . . . and in the end a self-destructive fool.
1	to invoke the right to deliberately distort what someone else has said is to assert the right to lie in print	masson has lost his case but the defendants and the profession to which they belong have lost far more
1	according to executives close to the situation merksamer filed for chapter 11 to speed the sale of the chain	an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of l.j. hooker corp. had frozen in place all of l.j. hooker's assets
1	after four years though the south gardens design is 100% uncollaborated jennifer bartlett	she has done little more than recycle her standard motifs -- trees water landscape fragments rudimentary square houses circles triangles rectangles -- and fit them into a grid as if she were making one of her gridded two-dimensional works for a gallery wall
1	but for south gardens the grid was to be a 3-d network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them	in a letter to the bpca kelly/varnell called this arbitrary and amateurish
1	in a letter to the bpca kelly/varnell called this arbitrary and amateurish	the landscape architects were expelled from the garden in july
1	after that the layout had been easy	i've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail
1	plant lovers who studied the maquette were alarmed	they looked at the miniature and saw a giant folly
1	a giant folly	ms. bartlett's little rooms left little room for plants or people
1	then to make these gardenettes quite literally rooms ms. bartlett had thrown up windowless walls (brick lattice hedge) eight to 10 feet tall casting her interiors into day-long stygian shade	it was hard to see how photosynthesis would ever happen in south gardens without decking the walls in a christmas-like array of gro-lites
1	the decidedly questionable safety of . . . a complex garden of endless hiding places	the 8 ft. hedges which obstruct views in and out of small `rooms' insure . . . that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime
1	primerica corp. new york raised its quarterly 14% to eight cents a share from seven cents payable nov. 24 to stock of record nov. 6	its continued confidence in the ongoing strength of the operations
1	that the founders had worried that congress might take the president out of the loop	article i section 7 clause 3 says that whether it's called an order resolution or vote or anything else presidents must have the chance to veto
1	article i section 7 clause 3 says that whether it's called an order resolution or vote or anything else presidents must have the chance to veto	labeling an omnibus budget a bill can't deprive the president of his power to veto items
1	but congress blinked before it could go to court	after the hud and s&l stories broke some congressmen began to worry that their influence peddling at executive-branch and independent agencies might some day get them in trouble
1	they worried about an interior department directive to log all communications with members or their staffs	congress inserted the following into the interior appropriation: none of the funds available under this title may be used to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the dept. of the interior and members and committees of congress and their staff
1	exactly right	now's the time to make the political case that presidents need the line-item weapon to restore discipline to the budget
1	but july 5 a thunderstorm in wilmington del. caused shellpot creek to rise 15 feet pouring 1.3 million gallons of water into basement vaults	the water destroyed about $75 million in currency and caked $4 million of coins with mud rendering them dangerous to counting machines
1	in fact there's only one person involved who's happy and that's floyd string president of coin wrap and conceiver of the cement-truck solution	not only did his company find $20 000 worth of work but when the approach was suggested brooks officials didn't laugh at me or anything
1	the shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low-crime business environments	private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi-public places
1	few small neighborhood businesses however can afford such protection even in collaboration with other local merchants	in the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates small business generally relies on the public police force for protection
1	in the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates small business generally relies on the public police force for protection	this creates several problems
1	a second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms	only half the new york small businesses surveyed for their part are satisfied with the police response they receive
1	another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small-business areas	for cities losing business to suburban shopping centers it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits
1	the unit bludgeoned by arizona's worsening real-estate woes will have a $174 million loss for the quarter	first interstate took a huge $350 million provision for loan losses at the arizona bank
1	at least six of arizona's 12 savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent	they are sitting on enormous unrecognized losses
1	the rapid deterioration of the arizona thrifts only adds to the ever-swelling cost of the government's massive thrift bailout officially estimated at about $166 billion	together the six government-controlled or essentially insolvent arizona thrifts have tangible capital of a negative $1.5 billion foreclosed property of $1.8 billion and pastdue loans of $1.63 billion
1	it's reasonable to say there is not a solvent s&l in the state and the amount of viable bank capital is very low	we're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end
1	we're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end	the only thing a lot of these lenders can get out of their mouth now is: `pay me in 60 days
1	the concern will be able to withstand the current downturn in arizona real estate	commercial paper holders have reinvested their funds and consumer deposits have been up in the last few days
1	conner dominates the market for hard-disk drives used to store data in laptop computers	that net income for its third quarter soared 72% to $11.8 million or 28 cents a share from $6.8 million or 19 cents a share in the year-ago period
1	conner's performance is closely tied to the burgeoning demand for battery-operated computers the computer industry's fastest-growing segment	since its inception conner has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to 10 times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines
1	in the coming months however this is likely to change	next month seagate technology plans to introduce its first family of low-power drives for battery-operated computers
1	they are going to catch up	both toshiba and nec already produce hard-disk drives and sony also is studying the field
1	these new products could account for as much as 35% of the company's business in 1990	we're not afraid of obsoleting some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition
1	their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children	under a 1981 missouri law persons accused of some crimes including trespassing may offer a defense that their actions were justified as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury
1	under a 1981 missouri law persons accused of some crimes including trespassing may offer a defense that their actions were justified as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury	relying on the preamble's statement that a fetus is an unborn child the two st. louis county circuit court judges in august accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives
1	that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass this will shut down abortion in missouri	there's no risk to the protesters and you can't keep an abortion clinic open if there are 3 000 people standing outside every day
1	the year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry	with the exception of van conversions the industry has seen a decline from 1988's robust sales
1	the dividend cut will prove most costly for john k. hanson winnebago's founder and chairman	based on his control of about 45% of winnebago's 24.7 million shares his annual dividend income would be cut to about $2.2 million from $4.4 million
1	to judge from novels that mirror the contemporary scene we're back in the age of anxiety	where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success it now seems that so many people feel they're slipping between the cracks that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing
1	nora who still has artistic aspirations knows she is lucky to be working as a food stylist prepping pies burgers frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera	after all there were housewives with nikons and degrees from cooking schools in france who would kill for her job
1	but nora and malcolm feel trapped	they seem to be having the worst of both worlds
1	in making malcolm and nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation ms. zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters	the humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts (even the characters' own) are likely to bleed for the plight of health-food eaters
1	mr. garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures	standard-issue portraits of flaky californians snobbish homosexuals and neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author's perceptions
1	yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this	if the head of aiw were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible malicious dolt we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated and would not be so diverted in the process
1	roland j. hawkins chairman of jet vacations inc. was elected to the board of this cruise line	the board expands to seven members
1	growth stocks will return to favor because of the jitters caused by the market's steep slide on oct. 13 and because of the current swell of disappointing earnings announcements announcements	against such a backdrop companies with proven track records of earnings gains of 20% or so annually have extra appeal
1	the main argument for growth stocks is their usually superior performance in a slowing economy	if the market refocuses on earnings we should get better valuations of growth stocks
1	if the market refocuses on earnings we should get better valuations of growth stocks	eventually investors will be willing to pay higher prices for companies with proven track records of earnings growth
1	eventually investors will be willing to pay higher prices for companies with proven track records of earnings growth	in anticipation of that shift he and other analysts are encouraging their clients to buy such issues now
1	some investors are skeptical of growth stocks because investing in them means ignoring that maxim found in the fine print of some investment advertisements -- that past performance isn't indicative of future results	people are naturally suspicious of them says mr. mullins of morgan stanley
1	earnings growth is beginning to play a greater part in investors' buying decisions	on friday hambrecht & quist added st. jude medical to the list of 20 stocks it strongly recommends
1	it was a busy week for otc stocks	friday's volume totaled 158.2 million shares
1	valley national lost 1 3/8 to 17 1/8 on volume of 1.9 million shares	the company reported a big third-quarter loss on thursday
1	among declining issues a weak earnings outlook drove groundwater technology down 6 1/4 to 24	the company said results for its second quarter ended oct. 28 could drop as much as 20% below the 30 cents a share reported in the year-earlier quarter
1	medstone international plummeted 3 1/4 to 7 1/4	a food and drug administration advisory panel has asked that medstone perform more studies on its device to treat gallstones
1	many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold	the fact that the city will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted as a sign that new york's budgetary problems are more serious than had been expected
1	that investors' concerns about the city's financial health are unwarranted given our proven ability to manage ourselves	he charges the city's critics with spreading unfounded emotional rhetoric
1	mr. jones takes heart	there in the center of the pack is quarterback troy aikman the key to the cowboys' comeback strategy
1	with three minutes left on the clock mr. aikman takes the snap steps back and fires a 21-yard pass -- straight into the hands of an atlanta defensive back	the crowd groans mr. jones shakes his head the cowboys lose the game
1	these days he isn't alone	nearly half the owners of the 28 national football league teams are losing money
1	for mr. jones it was just the beginning	he quickly cut the team's bloated administrative staff by half shut down a cowboys-owned dance academy and in july announced plans to sell valley ranch the team's 30-acre practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the nfl
1	mr. jones calls the ranch the pentagon of sportdom	it is a maze of halls that connects film rooms elaborate spas and weight-training centers that testify to a richer more free-spending era
1	with a new day dawning on the sport mr. jones doesn't see a place for this sort of luxury	it's just not cost efficient
1	and as for tom landry well he had played out his winning years	after posting losing seasons in each of the last three years the cowboys needed a change
1	the sales job seems to be paying off	when he bought the team only six of the suites had been sold
1	this wage inflation is bleeding the nfl dry	soon only large corporations will be able to afford to buy and run football teams
1	and are renegotiating dated stadium contracts	most of the owners must pay up to 10% of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old
1	we have the worst lease in the nfl	we're in a metro area with millions of bear fans and only a small number can be accommodated
1	we're in a metro area with millions of bear fans and only a small number can be accommodated	when the lease expires in 1999 it's got to be changed
1	like the game of professional football the nfl organization itself is in turmoil	the new breed of team owner mr. jones included has been fighting the nfl bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock
1	in july 11 nfl owners almost all of them new blocked an effort to install jim finks as a replacement for retiring league commissioner pete rozelle	mr. finks is perceived by some owners as a standard-bearer for the old guard
1	earlier this month another effort to choose a commissioner failed	the owners meet again tomorrow
1	i'm not here to make money by reselling the team later on	they can't be in the future
1	last year's retrenchment dried up the working capital of chinese factories	the company's sales flattened during 1989's first half
1	the import pie will shrink	on the down side sales could fall as much as 90% for some companies; on the upper side sales will be flat
1	import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to 16% in july and 7.1% in august compared with an average growth rate of 26% in the first half	in the first eight months of 1989 imports grew 21% to $38.32 billion down slightly from a growth rate of 23% a year earlier
1	the trend has prompted beijing to intensify efforts to curb imports	in recent weeks china's leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities
1	but the strategy isn't helping much this time	both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad
1	both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad	he expects the company's trading business to drop as much as 40% this year
1	for a short time after june 4 it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright	many foreign trading offices in hong kong were swamped with telexes and telephone calls from chinese trade officials urging them not to sever ties
1	but when foreign traders tried to do business they discovered that the eagerness of chinese trade officials was just a smokescreen	the suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of china's national trading companies which are among the country's biggest importers
1	sitco had customarily tapped the japanese bond market for funds but it can't do that any longer	the company is strapped for cash
1	it has difficulties paying its foreign debts	how can it make available funds for purchases
1	that as many as 70% of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in recent months	there are virtually no new projects and that means no new business for us
1	but the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices	to stem speculation beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year
1	to stem speculation beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year	traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling don't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock
1	but beijing can't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without hampering the country's export business	that as much as 50% of guangdong's exports is made up of processed imported raw materials
1	at least that's a theme emerging among many money managers who are anxious both to preserve the handsome stock-market gains they have already achieved this year and to catch the next wave of above-average performers	they are starting to buy growth stocks
1	carmine grigoli chief market strategist for first boston who still says we expect the dow average {to be at} 3000 by mid-1990 nonetheless foresees a sluggish economy in the meantime	he recommends such blue-chip growth stalwarts as philip morris pepsico cpc international reebok international and limited inc
1	he recommends such blue-chip growth stalwarts as philip morris pepsico cpc international reebok international and limited inc	all have a fiveyear earnings growth rate of more than 20% a year
1	some money managers are pursuing growth stocks at the expense of those that rise and fall along with the economic cycle	one of the stories of the fourth quarter is that we will get an unusual number of earnings disappointments from companies sensitive to the economy
1	but not all strategists or money managers are ready to throw in the towel completely on cyclicals	growth stocks may underperform cyclical stocks next year if the federal reserve begins to let interest rates drift sufficiently lower to boost the economy
1	goldman sachs's mr. einhorn for one subscribes to that scenario	he suggests investors think about buying cyclical shares in the weeks ahead as well as growth issues
1	instead he is looking for ways to exploit france's network of 39 000 tobacco agents most of them cafes	while seita doesn't own the french tabacs its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities
1	it also is trying to shore up its tobacco business	brown-tobacco cigarettes such as gauloises now make up just 40% of the french tobacco market
1	last week budget director richard darman structured the $16.1 billion spending reduction half of which must come from defense to impose a little bit more discipline by applying cuts to each individual program project or activity in the budget	that would give agencies less ability . . . to fudge over things
1	officially the statement isn't an attack on the rafale	adm. goupil said that when the f-18s wear out the navy is prepared to take rafales to replace them
1	the bay bridge will be closed for at least several weeks	part of the bridge collapsed in the quake
1	most unusual will be water-borne commuters from the east bay towns of oakland and berkeley	for the first time in 32 years ferry service has been restored between the east bay and san francisco
1	it also raised hackles of the city's tourism boosters	other cities are calling {groups booked here for tours and conferences} and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list
1	the preliminary conclusion from a survey of 200 downtown high-rises is that we were incredibly lucky	while many of these buildings sustained heavy damage little of that involved major structural damage
1	while many of these buildings sustained heavy damage little of that involved major structural damage	city building codes require construction that can resist temblors
1	earlier japan had said it might file a reservation against the ivory ban decided by ballot at the 103-nation united nations conference on international trade in endangered species in switzerland last week	the japanese use 40% of the world's ivory
1	east germany pledged to reduce alcohol consumption by boosting production of soft drinks and fruit juices	that the rise in alcohol consumption in east germany had been halted
1	that since some larger banks have already taken loss provisions for loans to other third world nations further write-offs could be viewed as intolerable	they can't take the hit to their earnings
1	but the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently didn't go far	that officials of saab's highly profitable scania truck operation balked at surrendering any of their autonomy
1	the most likely suitor for saab now is fiat	saab and fiat have worked together in the past
1	ford faces an uphill fight for jaguar however	they expect to have a friendly alliance with gm wrapped up by the end of the month
1	since the company's gilded brand image would give ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both europe and the u.s	last week ford encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its u.s. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its german-built scorpio sedan in the u.s. as a luxury import under the merkur brand name
1	on july 2 1987 the tanker s.s. glacier bay struck a rock and spilled almost 150 000 gallons of oil into the cook inlet	commercial fishermen and fish processors filed suit in federal court in a claim that has ballooned to more than $104.8 million
1	but the glacier bay case the fund's first test shows how easily the fund can be undermined	trinidad corp. is contesting liability
1	bar associations and consultants are offering more programs to teach associates all they need to know about law but didn't learn in law school	law school teaches wonderful theory but it doesn't teach the nuts and bolts of practical lawyering
1	i think this repeal was kind of a thoughtless action as a matter of fact	they will have to revisit this issue
1	that the ual pilots and management can put together a bid in the $225 area but that it could take three to four months to close	at that level and given the uncertainty he believes ual stock should trade closer to
1	that ual's board having accepted a bid of $300 a share might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level -- even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal	by that logic the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months
1	banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk that is subordinate to the bank debt in any deal	that way someone else has an even stronger motivation to make sure the deal is going to work because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs
1	one obstacle to the pilots' finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority ownership	investors such as marvin davis of los angeles who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted they not the pilots must have control
1	but it isn't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders	the lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied
1	using the the nwa takeover as a benchmark first boston on sept. 14 estimated that ual was worth $250 to $344 a share based on ual's results for the 12 months ending last june 30 but only $235 to $266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989	first boston's estimates had been higher before management supplied a 1989 projection
1	some analysts don't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots	the deal has so many moving parts
1	the deal has so many moving parts	i don't see anybody who's sophisticated getting his name associated with this mess until the moving parts stop moving

1	they continued to represent that to the board	we were reassured they would stand behind the company
1	that his company had opposed the chapter 11 filing	the company believed qintex entertainment's financial problems could have been resolved by other means
1	it's a shocker	qintex australia was going to pay more than $1 billion for mgm/ua and then they couldn't come up with the far smaller sum of $5.9 million
1	global allocation funds take the asset-allocation concept one step further by investing at least 25% of their portfolios outside the u.s	this gives them the added benefits of international diversification
1	the fund's strategy is to sell when a stock appreciates 30% over its cost	by the time the market plummeted 10 days ago monetta was 55% in cash
1	the fund was about half invested in government bonds on oct. 13 and about 10% in cash	in a downward market bonds act better
1	three international cash portfolios funds were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week	because the funds' investments are denominated in foreign currencies their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar
1	but when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies as it did for much of this year the dollar value of these funds declines	all three funds posted negative returns for the year to date
1	the small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign	that what happened last week may not be enough of an adjustment
1	that what happened last week may not be enough of an adjustment	there's either more to come or an extremely long period of dullness
1	but investors don't seem to think so	that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on the 13th
1	and traditionally its mayor is the nation's best-known urban politician	democrats hoped that mr. dinkins could become a highly visible national leader
1	i guess we'll reluctantly go ahead and do it vote for dinkins	there's nothing on the other side

1	he simply hasn't explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth $58 000 two years later	it's ludicrous for him to suggest it's the difference between the 'breakup' value of the shares and their market value
1	the crime goes to character	it's serious stuff
1	it makes people think maybe this guy isn't so squeaky clean after all	the result may turn out to be a lot closer than people think
1	as a channel islander i was amazed to see my birthplace listed as one of 86 countries with an income tax	despite a history of heated local debate on the topic my passport clearly reads british citizen

1	gen. scowcroft was a member of the tower commission which investigated the iran-contra affair	he was all too aware of how a large inadequately supervised nsc staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked president reagan's second term

1	the darpa funds are a pittance compared with what japan and other prospective competitors are spending	that japanese government and industry spending on hdtv research is already over $1 billion
1	in 1979 however westinghouse abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television	mr. brody left the company to find other backers
1	most american investors have just given up	they aren't prepared to compete in an area where the japanese want to enter
1	and transmitting information to combat commanders	the navy is ordering displays for its aegis cruisers and the army wants smaller versions for its abrams battle tanks
1	it isn't just yuppie television	the industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market
1	the small firms simply would prefer more darpa funds	each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial
1	they also want u.s. trade policy to reflect the pentagon and commerce department's concern over their future	they all are strongly opposed to a petition from several japanese tv manufacturers including matsushita hitachi and toshiba to exempt portable color tvs with liquid-crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the u.s. imposes on the larger japanese color tvs
1	and they want the u.s. to help them sell overseas	planar president james hurd says he has to pay tariffs as high as 15% to sell his display panels in japan and south korea while panels from those countries enter the u.s. duty-free
1	with an erosion of the customer base development capital and insurability	major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices
1	there is no question that vermont-slauson had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood	what had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that vermont-slauson yields
1	in the grand boulevard plaza developed by matanky realty group in chicago's third ward opposite the robert taylor homes 29% of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and 14% to members of other minority groups	children from the community will have worthier role models than the drug kingpins

1	still mr. utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by japanese banks	all week there has been much speculation in financial circles in tokyo and abroad about the ministry's real position
1	the {ministry} thinks the banks don't know what they are doing that they have very little idea how to cope with risk	the {ministry} wants to see the japanese banks pull in their horns on leveraged buy-outs
1	they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason	japanese banks are under political pressure as well
1	while recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy-out fever japanese banks aren't likely to walk away from the game	despite the risks the deals can be an attractive way for japanese banks to increase their presence in the u.s. market

1	in terms of sheer brutality the somali regime of siad barre may rank as no. 1 in the world	the only reason that somalia remains in obscurity is numbers
1	the only reason that somalia remains in obscurity is numbers: a sparsely populated wasteland of 8.5 million people spread out over an expanse nearly the size of texas	the barre dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people it can torture and kill
1	mr. mengistu is in an increasingly weak position	half his army is tied down defending the northern city of asmara from the eritreans
1	the weaker he gets the more he turns toward the u.s. for help	while the tigreans are communists like the eritreans they are among the most anti-soviet guerrillas in the world
1	but this is not enough	because the u.s. is still perceived to be tied to mr. barre when he goes the runway could go too
1	when he goes the runway could go too	considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the bush administration to blast the regime publicly in terms clear enough for all influential somalis to understand
1	considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the bush administration to blast the regime publicly in terms clear enough for all influential somalis to understand	it is a certainty that mr. barre's days are numbered

1	scientists need to understand that while they tend to believe their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good today it is also about power	in a media-linked world scientists may earn wide praise and even nobels for their work but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content funding and goals of that work
1	but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content funding and goals of that work	when a david baltimore -- or the next target -- decides it is better to stand up to these forces his fellow scientists would do well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake and offer their public support
1	mr. lesko figured he would be flooded with entries by now	after all we've got like 15 million bureaucrats

1	any raider would find it hard to crack ag's battlements	a syndicate of shareholders holds just under 50% of ag and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any ag shares
1	even without bid talk this year's surge in prices for brussels real estate has excited interest in ag	those holdings constitute the third-biggest real-estate portfolio in belgium
1	either way the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge	even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves such as saudi arabia and iraq could upset the market
1	under that approach countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in opec's production ceiling than they would under the current system	if you are already producing at 95% or 100% of your capacity what's the good to be told you can produce at 105% of capacity
1	saudi arabia opec's kingpin also has surfaced as a possible obstacle	insisting on a 24.5% share of any ceiling saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members
1	in fact the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes che guevara's famous linkages of art idealism and revolution seem modest	it is on behalf of these people and out of my real respect for them that i am responding to mr. asman's opinions of their country
1	mr. asman should make distinctions among fidel the army and the cuban people	they are not interchangeable
1	they are not interchangeable since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances	it is naivete to equate a government's policies with the will of the people
1	we badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom	without this basic level of attention to reality our policies on cuba will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30 years
1	you may be hearing more about the 38-year-old mr. mcdonough and his preoccupation with clean air	after years of relative obscurity he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture
1	now the question is: is poland ready for it	mr. mcdonough is about to tackle his biggest clean-air challenge yet the proposed warsaw trade center in poland the first such center in eastern europe
1	all architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work but we can't all carry it to that extreme	we're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily
1	since the 1970s energy crisis some efforts to conserve energy by sealing buildings have had an unintended side effect: high indoor pollution	to reduce it at the fund's building workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director's office
1	i guess i didn't really notice the trees	maybe they were hidden by all the people
1	the restaurant was conceived as a sparkling crystalline geode	it makes extensive use of stainless steel silver and aluminum that sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc-strip floors
1	if any nation can use environmentally benign architecture it is poland	that perhaps a quarter of poland's soil is too contaminated for safe farming because of air pollution
1	the future of the forest remains uncertain	mr. muniak's company balag ltd. has agreed to set aside the money to plant and maintain it but discussions are still going on over where to place it and how to ensure that it will be maintained

1	recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity	that the near-term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward
1	it means that the fed has a little leeway to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of rekindling inflation	we will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 1/2% in the next two weeks and 8% by year end
1	mr. kochan also likes long-term investment-grade corporate bonds and long-term treasurys	these bonds should appreciate in value as some investors seek safer securities
1	why should i bother with something that's an unknown for a very small pickup in yield	i'm not going to jump on them the first day they come out
1	the supply is not a constraint to the market	if one thinks that rates are going down you don't care how much supply is coming
1	there are about a dozen more deals coming	if they had this much trouble with chicago & north western they are going to have an awful time with the rest
1	campbell-mithun-esty for example has had big problems at its new york office but offers strong offices in other areas of the country including minneapolis and chicago	that would would make it appealing to a network such as interpublic that already has a healthy new york presence
1	campbell-mithun also would be a sizable addition to an agency network	it has billings of about $850 million and blue-chip clients including general mills jeep/eagle and dow brands
1	rowland meanwhile has expanded aggressively and now ranks as the fifth-largest u.s. public relations firm according to o'dwyer's directory of public relations firms	it would be attractive to an agency such as interpublic one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own
1	but his complaint that days of rage doesn't contain balanced comments from israelis about how badly the palestinians are behaving is irrelevant	it's like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white south africans are
1	well days of rage airing with before-and-after packaging and after repeated delays was a beginning	every issue is multisided
1	this time we don't really have to worry about tokyo	nothing has changed fundamentally in the tokyo market
1	it was all over the place	if you bought you wish you hadn't and if you sold you wish you hadn't
1	and the sentiment in london is 90% anxiety and worry	britain's economic fundamentals don't look very bright
1	but whitbread class a shares rose 17 to 363	there was late talk of a whitbread sale of brewing operations to scottish & newcastle
1	the most active shares were major blue-chips	the action in them largely to defensive positioning in a volatile market
1	meanwhile sotheby's guarantee is raising eyebrows in the art world	the consumer has to throw out the idea that the auction house is a disinterested middleman

1	the december contract declined 1.85 cents a pound to $1.2645	according to one analyst workers at the cananea copper mine in mexico which hasn't been operating since it was declared bankrupt by the mexican government in late august are set to return to work
1	the cananea return to operation may not be as near as some expect	there are still negotiations taking place on whether there will be a loss of jobs

1	anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line	if a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble it will be a problem for the long run
1	the customer will react to strength	ignore the present condition
1	that isn't easy	wang's customers are data processing managers who want to be sure that their suppliers are stable wellrun companies that will be around to fix bugs and upgrade computers for years to come
1	the first priority for wang's sales force is to make sure it holds on to existing customers	wang's installed base is one of its greatest assets and many of those customers remain extremely loyal

1	but if east germany's arthritic politburo does loosen up enough to permit mr. krenz to make serious efforts at reform he will face a challenge just as fundamental	abandoning socialism means abandoning the east german state's reason for existence and with it the justification for its watchdogs and its wall
1	abandoning socialism means abandoning the east german state's reason for existence and with it the justification for its watchdogs and its wall	in this scenario it's hard to imagine that a pale imitation of the federal republic could avoid being pulled into some kind of tie with west germany
1	when poland moves to reform it can at least lean on its past	however flawed and short-lived joseph pilsudski's interwar republic it was a nonsocialist democracy
1	with talk today of a second economic miracle in west germany east germany no longer can content itself with being the economic star in a loser league	without moscow's military and party behind it east germany runs the risk of disintegrating
1	if it goes capitalist and increases trade with west germany it will convert itself willy-nilly into an economic annex of the federal republic	there's a certain cruel logic at work here: it's particularly appropriate -- and tragic -- that the land that produced karl marx should prove socialism's failure in an experiment that uses its own people as controls
1	the arab states always bitterly resentful of u.s. support toward israel realized they held an irresistable weapon -- oil	early in october six arab nations in the persian gulf jacked up prices sharply

1	the figures today add further evidence to support the view that the improvement in the u.s. trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a $110 billion annual rate	that's still an improvement over last year but it leads one to conclude that basically we've gotten all the mileage we can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit
1	in addition the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of u.s. products in overseas markets and hurt the country's competitiveness	since march exports have been virtually flat
1	but farmington n.m.-based mesa said the offer was for $7 in cash and unspecified stateswest securities valued at $3 a share	based on the number of mesa shares outstanding not already owned by stateswest the proposed takeover would have a value of about $15.3 million

1	ethan bronner's battle for justice: how the bork nomination shook america (norton 399 pages $22.50) is a spirited narrative of the nastiest of these hearings done with journalistic verve but with a flawed legal philosophy	while the book amply justifies its subtitle the title itself is dubious
1	while the book amply justifies its subtitle the title itself is dubious	what shook america was not a battle for justice but for naked power
1	i doubt that	given democratic frustration with the reagan victories and court appointments the contingency plans in place and mr. bork's paper trail of vulnerable writings it was pretty clear that judge bork never stood much chance of being confirmed
1	further ammunition came from left legal theorist ronald dworkin	the charge of being outside the mainstream of legal thought gravely undercut mr. bork's scholarly standing
1	still the long view of robert bork as constitutional thinker must be a spotty one	his strength lies in his majoritarian doctrine which keeps the court clear of transient group pressures and leaves most decisions in a democracy to elected legislatures and executives.
1	in our time abortion has become another best left to a line of supreme court decisions rather than to the chaos of 50 state legislatures	a reflective and growing consensus of americans clearly wishes to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters (decided in the griswold case) to abortion as well
1	a reflective and growing consensus of americans clearly wishes to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters (decided in the griswold case) to abortion as well	one can understand mr. bork's fear that the new right to privacy will become intolerably stretched though a supreme court composed of men and women with realism guts and a sense of limits should be able to manage it
1	these rate indications aren't directly comparable	lending practices vary widely by location

1	but the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues	many members feel there are important features of the house bill that should be enacted
1	many members feel there are important features of the house bill that should be enacted	if there is any support for reducing the bill it is conditioned on their desire to see them passed in another form
1	you've got to give these chairmen the opportunity to see if they can work things out	this is a democratic process -- you can't slam-dunk anything around here
1	i approached mastergate larry gelbart's new comedy at the criterion center with considerable trepidation	nothing i assumed would be more hopelessly dated than a political satire on the iran-contra affair
1	and the persistence of scandal in washington	though the play clearly is framed around the events of iran-contra it takes in the wide sweep of scandals over the past 30 years
1	the metaphor of theater is not entirely coincidental	mr. gelbart clearly feels that all the participants in a congressional hearing are performers
1	this interest in words goes beyond puns and playfulness however	mr. gelbart deplores the obfuscation the circumlocution and the debasement of language he sees on all sides
1	both messrs.	if there's any coincidence about the departures it's that they are leaving at a time when the business is in reasonably good shape and going forward very well
1	and in a neighborly spirit hit both the gutfreunds and the building with a $35 million lawsuit	nothing less it seemed could console them for their traumas
1	mr. gutfreund collected $32 million while billy salomon got $10 million much less than if he had conducted the sale	i felt betrayed
1	worse salomon's timing had been off	its profits unlike phibro's soared over the next two years and had it held out salomon could have gotten an even bigger bundle
1	second a long-term shareholder of a good company needn't worry too much when the stock price drops temporarily	it will bounce back
1	however on balance the charity game helps america	if those who have the money don't get involved with the museums and the charities then city hall will do it badly
1	advanced micro devices inc. sunnyvale integrated circuit maker annual sales of $1.12 billion nyse had only minor structural damage	most of its 4 500 workers were at work yesterday and no production slowdown was anticipated as long as electricity remains available
1	american president cos. oakland shipping concern annual sales of $2.2 billion nyse had little damage to the cranes dock or rail track at its container-ship facility near the collapsed route 880 overpass	the company expects to work a ship due in today with minimal delays despite sporadic power
1	apple computer co. cupertino computer maker annual sales of $4.07 billion otc sustained some structural damage	offices were closed yesterday

1	flooding caused by broken water pipes closed its san jose plant	the plant and its 8 500 employees gradually will resume operations over the next several days
1	fortunately volunteers and charities are not motivated by self-interest but by altruism	why should they have to co-exist with opportunists rushing in to turn a quick profit
1	mr. laband should beware since he lives in south carolina	in a free market his insurance rates can be raised to recover insurance-company losses
1	his theoretical approach and its publication in this venerable paper are no doubt a noteworthy accomplishment for him	too bad theory fails in practice
1	we consumers tend to have long memories	the businesses subscribing to mr. laband's effective price system will be remembered when normalcy returns

1	the u.s. chamber of commerce has been in the forefront in supporting the bush proposal	it endorsed the white house strategy believing it to be the surest way to victory
1	two hours later the first word emerged on capitol hill that the administration had agreed to reconciliation with no such assurances from senate democrats	mr. rahn was shocked telephoning the office of richard darman director of the office of management and budget and the administration's chief strategist on this issue
1	the stock market reacted as mr. rahn did	the stock market after all represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation's capital stock discounted to present value
1	the counter-argument is that if he and his fellow democrats are successful in killing the president's proposal the revenue gap will open up tremendously in 1990 because of the weakened economy	there would be no serious consideration of tax increases
1	we're extremely committed to optical storage technology	we think everything will go this way in a few years
1	educators added that next needs to soon offer a color version of its computer	every major maker offers computers with color displays
1	the firm has a straight mathematical formula for determining compensation based on the firm's earnings	just because a particular element of the firm is down such as stockbrokerage doesn't mean the executive committee should be paid less

1	much of the jockeying by otc traders and investors centered on shares of companies that might be financially affected by damage from the devastating earthquake in northern california	shares of a number of companies that might either profit or face problems because of the disaster were actively traded
1	in other earthquake-related news hambrecht & quist's otc market makers were excused from trading yesterday and its positions were frozen for the day by the national association of securities dealers	power couldn't be restored at the company's san francisco headquarters to allow trading yesterday morning
1	this seems to be the season for revivals in chicago	though the cubs' championship season ended with the national league playoffs a revival of the organic theater's production of bleacher bums a play in nine innings set in the wrigley field bleachers continues within spitting distance of the ballpark
1	but if you happen to be coming to chicago in the next few weeks don't fail to have a look at robert falls's the misanthrope at the goodman	if mr. wilbur's translation is a finely ground lens through which we see the pettiness and corruption of 17th-century paris mr. falls's production is a mirror in which we see ourselves
1	but under jerry perry's direction the current steppenwolf production scheduled to play through nov. 19 breaks through the flat and boring ritual that the homecoming had become	led by a near-perfect performance by alan wilder as max the father the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a family's rage bitterness fear and isolation
1	in the end teddy returns alone to america leaving ruth in max's chair	we have seen her develop within a few hours from a shy and unknown in-law to a goddess of the flesh who will replace the dead mother and then some
1	to buy a piece of real estate in the city's rapidly reviving north halsted street restaurant and theater district	within a year steppenwolf will move into a new 500-seat theater on that site
1	the troupe currently performs in a converted dairy that seats 211 and provides little capacity for staging anything beyond a simple one-set production	if we wanted to stage `death of a salesman willie loman would have to live in a ranch house because of the low ceiling
1	steppenwolf needs the extra seats even more than the fly space	it's currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the 13 000 who can be accommodated in its present digs
1	the rest he is confident can be raised	his board members alone have pledged $800 000 and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations
1	but welles's theater company turned out to have a brief -- one might say a mercurial -- existence	what will mr. sagan do with his new theater building if the allure of hollywood and broadway proves too much for such steppenwolf stalwarts as john malkovich ( dangerous liaisons ) joan allen ( the heidi chronicles ) and glenne headly ( lonesome dove ) and the company crumbles
1	this is the type of fire insurance you only buy when the nearby woods are on fire	but you don't always feel the need for your investments to be insured
1	if the stock goes up in price between now and the put's expiration date the put will probably expire worthless	the investor will be out the cost of the put and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit
1	if the stock stays at the same price between now and the put's expiration date the investor's loss will be limited to the cost of the put less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put	the worst-case scenario would be if the put expires worthless
1	for example tenneco inc. pays a quarterly dividend of 76 cents which would be received before the february option expires and thus reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount	in this case the investor's risk wouldn't exceed 3.6% of the total investment
1	the outcome of our leveraged buyout is looking very positive	unlike most of the other retailers mentioned in the story jos.
1	unlike most of the other retailers mentioned in the story jos.	we did experience some difficulties with the initial lbo terms and as your article made clear successfully restructured our debt earlier this year something those other retailers have yet to accomplish
1	profit-taking accounted for much of the slide in otc stock prices according to david mills senior vice president of boston company advisers	many portfolio managers whose year-end bonuses are tied to annual performance are selling now rather than risk seeing their gains erode further
1	tax-loss sellers those investors who sell loss-making stocks so they can deduct their losses from this year's income are also getting out	that's helping put pressure on both the market's winners and its losers
1	daimler-benz joined the list of companies interested in the british car maker	it has had talks with jaguar about possible joint ventures
1	showbiz pizza time gained 1 1/2 to 13	the company reported third-quarter operating profit of 37 cents a share compared with 12 cents a share a year earlier
1	old stone fell 1 5/8 to 13 1/2	late friday the company reported a loss of $51.3 million for the third quarter after earning $9.2 million a year before
1	but she declined	the agency then turned to a former backup singer for ms. midler who appeared in the ad and crooned what was generally considered a more than credible imitation of ms. midler's 1973 hit song do you wanna dance
1	that the verdict reaffirms her position and our position that advertisers and advertising agencies cannot with impunity imitate the voices of well-known performers	that is a property right that belongs to the performer
1	that the latest decisions are having a chilling effect	it has made people think twice about how they use music and is forcing them to be more circumspect about doing a particular rendition of a song in its most famous form
1	the timing of his visit was fortuitous	the man who had brought it in for an estimate had returned to collect it and was waiting in the hall
1	the cup had been insured and in short order it was given over to a chubb & son representative	the original owners happily repaid the claim and took their kylix home
1	but on oct. 6 he had reason to celebrate	two days earlier his attorney met in a park avenue law office with a cartoon dealer who expected to sell 44 of the most important stolen strips to mr. russell for $62 800.
1	the air-waybill number was changed en route and paper work showing that the crates had cleared customs was misplaced so it was a week before three of the four crates could be located in a bonded warehouse and the gauguin discovered missing	although heathrow authorities have been watching a group of allegedly crooked baggage handlers for some time the gauguin may be lost
1	yesterday quebecor inc. a montreal printing publishing and forest-products company 53%-owned by mr. peladeau agreed to acquire maxwell communication corp. 's u.s. printing subsidiary maxwell graphics inc. for $500 million in cash and securities	the purchase will make quebecor the second-largest commercial printer in north america behind only r.r. donnelley & sons co. chicago
1	he already has achieved vertical integration on a limited scale	quebecor can put a weekly newspaper on almost any quebec doorstep without using outside help
1	this is a great strategic move for quebecor	they are buying an operation that is running well
1	he isn't trying to catch up to donnelley which has annual sales of over $3 billion	size doesn't matter
1	more recently some former quebecor executives started their own printing company specializing in printing and distributing advertising circulars	quebecor still lags in the quebec circulars market while mr. peladeau's former employees are expanding across canada
1	still mr. peladeau stuck with the venture	now the journal flush with ads and hugely profitable is even with la presse in weekend circulation and outsells it 3 to 2 every weekday
1	the maxwell deal is quebecor's second big printing acquisition in just over a year	last october quebecor bought 23 canadian printing plants from bce inc. a montreal telecommunications manufacturing energy and real estate company
1	democracy is making a return with a vengeance to latin america's most populous and deeply indebted country	on nov. 15 when brazilians elect a president for the first time in 29 years the country's 82 million voters will have 22 candidates to choose from
1	a half-dozen candidates backing policies ranging from thatcherism to watered-down marxism are given a chance of winning	whoever says he knows which of the six will win is out of his mind
1	oh that terrible mr. ortega	just when american liberalism had pulled the arms plug on the contras and their friend ronald reagan along comes mr. ortega in costa rica this weekend to blunder into the hands of what are often called conservatives
1	when a hospital in lexington installed a lithotripter last year demand for a similar kidney-stone smashing machine at a humana hospital in louisville fell 34%	the humana hospital responded by jacking up prices to make up for lost revenue
1	it also saves money	because patients require less attention from nurses and other staff room charges are lower
1	the market was pretty dull for most of the day	some investors were reluctant to plunge into the market ahead of several key economic indicators due this week especially friday's potentially market-moving employment report
1	despite yesterday's modest bond market gains investors are anxious about the treasury's huge quarterly refunding of government debt	it could be delayed if congress and president bush fail to increase the treasury's borrowing capacity
1	strong demand for new york city's $813 million general obligation bonds propped up the municipal market	most municipal bonds ended 1/2 point higher
1	the second large deal in the past week	last week a unit of mnc financial corp. offered $268 million of home-equity securities
1		suppliers and subcontractors are experiencing heightened pressure to support delivery schedules
1	also a contract with the united auto workers at the company's helicopter plant in philadelphia expired oct. 15	this contract covering about 3 000 hourly production and maintenance workers is being extended on a day-to-day basis
1	the reluctance of traders to buy contracts indicates that they have begun focusing on demand rather than supply	that as production improves the concern among traders is whether the prospective increased supply will find buyers because of uncertainty over national economies
1	it's a super-exciting set of discoveries	only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level
1	scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors or simply anti-cancer genes	when functioning normally they make proteins that hold a cell's growth in check
1	so for cancer to arise both copies must be impaired	a person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene or in whom one copy is damaged early in life is especially prone to cancer
1	the dedham mass. couple knew even before bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a 50% chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma	he carried a damaged gene having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old
1	that little will quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and therefore faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer	it made our new year
1	the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes alone or in combination appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain the skin kidney prostate and cervix	that if people inherit defective versions of these genes they are especially prone to cancer perhaps explaining finally why some cancers seem to haunt certain families
1	under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing	he assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer
1	the finding riveted medicine	it was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer
1	it was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer	it was extraordinarily satisfying
1	it was extraordinarily satisfying	i was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers
1	dr. vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer the second biggest cancer killer in the u.s. after lung cancer	he believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple hits on cancer suppressor genes because it often seems to develop in stages
1	if both copies of a second gene were then deleted the polyps would progress to malignancy	it was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop
1	their report galvanized other molecular biologists	it was the confirming evidence we all needed that {gene} losses were critical to the development of a common tumor
1	they focused on chromosome 17	for months the johns hopkins researchers using gene probes experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17 looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells
1	for months the johns hopkins researchers using gene probes experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17 looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells	such a piece of dna would probably constitute a gene
1	researchers in edinburgh scotland have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies	that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families the gene when inherited in a damaged form may predispose women to the cancer
1	japanese corporations' reputation as hi-tech powerhouses is only half right	their factories may look like sets for a spielberg movie but their offices with rows of clerks hunched over ledgers and abacuses are more like scenes from a dickens novel
1	and with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency more and more japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice	we have too many people in our home offices
1	we have too many people in our home offices	productivity in japanese offices is relatively low
1	moreover japanese offices tend to use computers less efficiently than american offices do	in the u.s. pcs commonly perform many tasks and plug into a broad network.
1	for the past decade nec corp. has owned more than half the japanese pc market and ruled it with near-monopoly power	with little competition the computer industry here is inefficient
1	but early on ibm offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it	dozens of small companies did swiftly establishing a standard operating system
1	nec won't release its code and every one of the dozen or so makers has its own proprietary operating system	but nec was ahead from the start and didn't need to invite in competitive allies
1	most rivals have a working relationship with nec often through cross-licensing of technology	they hesitate to market nec-compatible machines
1	they hesitate to market nec-compatible machines	nec disapproves of such machines and marketing one would jeopardize their relationship
1	because nec is enjoying a monopoly	there are no price wars no competition
1	but the market is changing	the government is funding several projects to push pc use
1	in a country where elbow room is scarce laptop machines will take a large portion of the industry's future growth	toshiba corp. busted open that sector this summer with a notebook-sized machine that retails for less than 200 000 yen
1	but it could also help american companies which also are starting to try to open the market	as with many other goods the american share of japan's pc market is far below that in the rest of the world
1	though no formal trade barriers exist the japanese computer industry is difficult for outsiders to enter	if it were an open market we would have been in in 1983 or 1984
1	but the americans are also to blame	they long made little effort here
1	but wire transfers from a standing account -- including those bigger than $10 000 -- aren't reported	this has left a gaping loophole that illegal drug businesses are exploiting
1	the $40 million will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of eastern's plan	forty million in the total scheme of things is not that significant
1	however since eastern first filed for chapter 11 protection march 9 it has consistently promised to pay creditors 100 cents on the dollar	because the carrier is still pledging to do that some committee members successfully argued that there's little reason yet to explore a different plan according to one person familiar with the creditors' position
1	and that the two sides were still negotiating	in every case people would like to see a consentual plan
1	known as easy eggs the product has disappointed investors	when the company this month announced lower-than-forecast sales of easy eggs the stock dropped nearly 19%
1	michael won't confirm the identities of any easy egg customers nor will it say much of anything else	two minneapolis shareholder suits in the past month have accused top officers of making various untrue statements
1	still caution is advisable	michael's break-even volume on easy eggs is around 60 million pounds a year -- apparently well above current shipments and a far cry from what the company once suggested was a billion-pound market waiting for such a product
1	the last remaining bull on the stock	that michael foods is misunderstood
1	that michael foods is misunderstood	this is a growth company in the packaged food industry -- a rare breed like finding a white rhino
1	but dry growing conditions in the red river valley of minnesota and north dakota are pushing spot prices of potatoes beyond what michael contracted to pay last spring	company lawyers recently sent letters to growers saying that michael would take very seriously any effort . . . to divert its contracted-for potatoes to other outlets
1	foothills' main rival to build a mackenzie delta pipeline is likely to be transcanada pipelines	the toronto-based company together with tenneco inc. of houston has had an incomplete proposal filed with canadian regulators since 1984 that it is now updating
1	like foothills transcanada's polar gas consortium plans to build a pipeline directly south from the mackenzie river delta in canada's western arctic with an initial capacity to transport 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas daily	they expect a fierce battle to emerge between transcanada which has a monopoly on canadian gas transportation east of alberta and nova and westcoast which control the pipelines within and running west of alberta respectively
1	this is virgin territory unclaimed and it's going to be nasty	neither is going to back down easily
1	sen. strom thurmond (r. s.c.) recently urged fellow lawmakers to revive a broad federal death penalty	the ultimate punishment will protect the law-abiding from the vicious cruel individuals who commit these crimes
1	the law that sen. thurmond is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the maryland restaurant murders and almost all other killings	most murders are state crimes
1	for one thing it's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences let alone be executed	most of the crimes incorporated in the thurmond bill are exceedingly rare
1	that burden is very difficult if not impossible to meet	how do you prove a negative
1	how do you prove a negative	since most prosecutors wouldn't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations didn't affect sentencing executions everywhere might come to a halt
1	the kennedy amendment would in effect legislate around the supreme court ruling	lawyers would eagerly seize on the provision in their death-penalty appeals
1	the plan calls for cray research holders to receive one share in the new company for every two shares held	an estimated 14.7 million cray computer shares will be distributed
1	yet the rowing machine hasn't been touched since	but it left grease marks on his carpet and it was boring
1	it's a horrible machine actually	i'm ashamed i own the stupid thing
1	nearly three-fourths of the people who own home exercise equipment don't use it as much as they planned according to the wall street journal's american way of buying survey	almost half of the exercise equipment owners found it duller than they expected
1	some people don't use their machines as much as they should	the first excuse is they don't have enough time the second is they don't have enough discipline
1	nancy igdaloff may be a good prospect for such a gizmo	she's trying to sell a $150 exercise bike she bought about five years ago for her roommate
1	i'm using it a lot	i spent so much money that if i look at it and i'm not on it i feel guilty
1	people say they swim and that may mean they've been to the beach this year	it's hard to know if people are responding truthfully
1	it's hard to know if people are responding truthfully	people are too embarrassed to say they haven't done anything
1	but even that goal may prove optimistic	of 14 activities the journal survey found that 12 -- including bicycling skiing and swimming -- are being done by fewer americans today than eight years ago
1	slightly more like leslie sherren a law librarian in san francisco who attends dance aerobics five times a week exercise to relieve stress	working with lawyers i need it
1	they didn't need to belong to a health club	they're too crowded and everybody's showing off
1	people were going nuts the minute we opened three days after the quake	the emotional aspect is so draining they needed a good workout
1	that the bowling alley may be an endangered american institution	the number of people who said they bowl regularly has fallen to just 8% from 17% in 1981
1	the nissan logo flashed on the screen for a moment and then came a taped plea for donations from former president reagan -- followed by the silent print telling viewers where to call	within two hours viewers pledged over $400 000 according to a red cross executive
1	but the strategy can backfire	if the ads appear too self-serving the companies may end up looking like rank opportunists instead of good samaritans
1	at nissan we felt we wanted to do something to help them gather money and we had this airtime on monday night football	what did we get out of it
1	but as advertisers latch onto disasters with increasing frequency they risk hurting themselves as much as helping the cause	they chance alienating the customers they hope to woo by looking like opportunistic sharks
1	it can backfire because companies can step across the line and go too far be too pushy	the ultimate form of charity is when you don't tell anyone
1	that only a few of the quake-related campaigns have been tasteless and that the majority have been truly beneficial to the people who need the help	we don't consider that ambulance chasing
1	the definitive agreements require that anchor obtain a waiver from its bank lenders of existing covenant defaults under its bank facilities	since anchor is still seeking this waiver the tender offer is being extended until 5 p.m. est tomorrow
1	that mr. gorbachev's problems result from the failure of his own system	they can be relieved only by changing that system not by pouring western money into it
1	on the other hand so long as mr. gorbachev is easing his grip on his empire everyone we've heard agrees that the u.s. can benefit by engaging him	if a deal can be made to cut the world's ortegas loose from moscow why not
1	even if the press is ready to seize and misinterpret these are not very complicated thoughts	surely there is someone in the administration maybe bob gates who could explain them to college students or even schoolchildren
1	the agency also concluded that ltv's financial status had improved while it was under reorganization	in september 1987 it ordered ltv to reassume liability and funding for the three original plans
1	the biotechnology firms may be setting up their own competitors	that until now the japanese have only acquired equity positions in u.s. biotechnology companies
1	the building rocked	for a while it looked like the deal -- not to mention the courtroom itself -- was on the verge of collapse
1	and the lawyers were just as eager as the judge to wrap it up	we were never going to get these insurance companies to agree again
1	i didn't know if it was world war iii or what	reading the settlement into the record was the last thing on my mind
1	the dollar will continue to hold its current tight trading pattern	that weakness in both the yen and sterling have helped offset bearish u.s. economic news and have lent support to the dollar
1	the soviets have a world-leading space program	wouldn't the japanese like a piece of it
1	the sales pitch mightn't be as farfetched as it seems	japan-u.s. trade relations are bumpy these days and some japanese favor decreasing their reliance on u.s. technology in light of the fsx fighter-plane flap when u.s. officials reversed an earlier decision and refused to share certain crucial fighter-plane technology
1	they believe technology is one of their best bets	the soviets held export exhibitions that included high-tech items in new york and west germany
1	but they also hope to benefit from japanese manufacturing expertise	the soviet union has a lot of know-how but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy
1	the soviet union has a lot of know-how but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy	the soviets are contemplating a flexible system under which it would be possible to develop {technology} jointly and even to market it jointly
1	such discussions would be fraught with political complications	many japanese are eager to avoid appearing to help the soviets in any way
1	the issue is far-reaching	right now the american populace is spending about 12% of our gross national product on health care
1	nearly 10 years ago representatives of service-sector companies worked out a plan with the commerce department to improve the data on service-sector exports	both groups believed that tens of billions of dollars of service exports were not being counted as exports
1	these revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar	the materially smaller trade deficit may have been already discounted in the market
1	too early to tell but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture	it does not relieve the need for our market-opening efforts for both goods and services but it does suggest that it is our exports of services and not just borrowing that is financing our imports of goods
1	permission is far from automatic	the soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions and they appear to be exercising these powers
1	along with some other revealing indicators these developments suggest that while mr. gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the austrian or chicago schools of economic thought	mr. gorbachev has ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods
1	the closeness of soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of mussolini was evident when mr. gorbachev presented his economic vision to the soviet congress	in doing so he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market
1	mr. gorbachev is in a much stronger position to pursue the corporatist ideal than was mussolini	the soviet communist party has the power to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it
1	at the same time he must give it sufficient freedom to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed	it is the promise of economic returns that is supposed to make the corporatist model attractive to both the party and labor
1	at the same time the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine western-style political pluralism	the most important development in mr. gorbachev's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the u.s.s.r. also suffers from terrorism
1	an increasing number of references by the soviet press to opposition groups now active in the u.s.s.r. particularly the democratic union allege that they show terroristic tendencies and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims	it is possible that in perpetuating such myths the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism
1	mr. gorbachev would appear to see his central task however as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo	if he were able to construct a popular and efficient corporatist system he or his heir would be wellplaced to rein in political opposition and to re-establish control in eastern europe
1	the weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations but in its economic prescription	contrary to widespread belief mussolini failed to live up to his promise to make the trains run on time

1	kidder made an abrupt about-face on program trading yesterday	just a week ago mr. carpenter staunchly defended index arbitrage at kidder the most active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year
1	big institutional investors which he wouldn't identify told us they wouldn't do business with firms that continued to do index arbitrage for their own accounts	we were following the trend of our competitors who were under pressure from institutions
1	if they think they are going to stop index arbitrage by causing a few wall street firms to quit they are crazy	it's not going to stop it at all
1	we are reaching the moment of truth on wall street	wall street} is beginning to realize -- as shakespeare said -- the trouble is not in our stars but in ourselves

1	last year's series broadcast by general electric co. 's nbc was the lowest-rated series in four years	instead of featuring a major east coast team against a west coast team it pitted the los angeles dodgers against the losing oakland a's

1	it can be hoped that spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory sunday	a strong challenge from the far left the communist coalition izquierda unida failed to topple him
1	a strong challenge from the far left the communist coalition izquierda unida failed to topple him	he should consider his victory a mandate to continue his growth-oriented economic reforms and not a demand that he move further left
1	the far left had some good issues even if it did not have good programs for dealing with them	it could point to plenty of ailments that the spanish economic rejuvenation so far has failed to cure
1	yet the best the far-left could do was not enough to deter the biggest voting bloc -- nearly 40% -- from endorsing the direction spain is taking	now he can go further
1	they as well as numerous latin american and east european countries that hope to adopt elements of the spanish model are supporting the direction spain is taking	it would be sad for mr. gonzalez to abandon them to appease his foes

1	after-the-fact judicial examination of an actor's conduct has always been the common law's method	when only civil liability is involved this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization

1	elections in this large diverse and passionate nation are always hard to predict	much depends on the opposition a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former gandhi cabinet minister vishwanath pratap singh
1	in a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone a job and even into a school the name bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government	that illustrates the kind of disappointment many indians feel toward mr. gandhi whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power
1	but the average indian had tremendous hope in the youthful leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt	his failures in those two areas deeply and sometimes bitterly disappointed many indians
1	we don't like the congress (i)	the congress government is taking the farmers' bread and not giving us any support

1	but u.s. intelligence rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy merely filed the report away	mr. noriega's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to u.s. interests
1	the u.s. has befriended and later turned against many dictators but none quite so resourceful	the 55-year-old mr. noriega isn't as smooth as the shah of iran as well-born as nicaragua's anastasio somoza as imperial as ferdinand marcos of the philippines or as bloody as haiti's baby doc duvalier.
1	the u.s. underestimated noriega all along	he has mastered the art of survival

1	mr. noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked laughing at them and then retreating to his office	people started wondering if something was wrong with him
1	that gen. torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the u.s	everybody was afraid of him

1	in the world of intelligence if you want to get information you get it from seedy characters	the question is how much you get tied in with seedy characters so they can extort you
1	at the time though in 1979 the u.s. was once again flirting with its longtime latin american spy	mr. noriega made plans to fly to washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the pentagon
1	mr. noriega's friend mr. wittgreen would be handling the shah's security	it wouldn't be a good idea to indict him -- much less mr. noriega
1	if we had been allowed to go ahead then we wouldn't have the problems we have now	if he had been found guilty we could have stopped him
1	although working for u.s. intelligence mr. noriega was hardly helping the u.s. exclusively	during the reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the cubans and the sandinistas

1	anti-nuclear activists have protested the launch of the galileo space probe to jupiter because it uses plutonium to generate the electricity needed to run the craft	that if the shuttle carrying galileo into orbit should explode or if galileo itself crashes into the earth during the two times it flies close to the planet fatal levels of plutonium would be released into the atmosphere
1	some economists expect further declines in investment spending	whenever corporate profits are weak that means capital spending is going to soften subsequently
1	and is having difficulty breaking out above that	producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which to sell gold
1	there is little to motivate gold traders to buy the metal	investors in the u.s. and europe are comfortable with the actions of the {federal reserve} in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system
1	there isn't any rush on the part of investors in the west to buy gold	they still bear the memory of october 1987 when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell
1	there is little incentive on the part of traders to sell gold because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its `flight to safety' quality.	this is keeping the gold traders handcuffed

1	his speech criticized the idiocy of notions of protected groups in society as opposed to individual equality or as he put it in a common destiny as americans	instead of lobbying for special treatment that homosexuals and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk invidious retrenchment with government complicity
1	this hardly sounds like an anti-homosexual screed	what's really going on here

1	but the warranty on simpler parts would be lowered to two years or 24 000 miles	they would benefit because car owners would be less likely to go back to dealers for the simpler repairs after two years

1	with the february 1987 u.n. accords relating to afghanistan the soviet union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control	the terms of the geneva accords leave moscow free to provide its clients in kabul with assistance of any kind -- including the return of soviet ground forces -- while requiring the u.s. and pakistan to cut off aid
1	moscow claims this is all needed to protect the kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance	it is well-known that the regular afghan infantry is filled with reluctant conscripts
1	but this is not the entire afghan army and it is no longer kabul's only military force	complete units have been trained and indoctrinated in the u.s.s.r. and other east bloc nations; 30 000 to 40 000 of these troops have returned
1	at the last minute however pakistani officials sent in gulbuddin hekhmatyar perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces	the deal fell through and kandahar remains a major regime base
1	a cutoff of u.s. military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain	creation of a new realistic u.s. policy is long overdue
1	it will take several meetings to resolve this	we don't want to bring back something the members will reject
1	but most experts agree that the concept that is to be introduced drags in great complexity	they have been trying to head it off this year

1	even though these favorable trends in lung-cancer mortality affect all sex and race groups they can't be taken for granted	smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population especially children adolescents and minorities
1	but the editorial by jan stjernsward of the world health organization notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries	non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior around the world the editorial says through the enactment of laws that limit advertising boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education

1	when a decade ago some marin county bicycle enthusiasts created a hybrid bike using fat tires lightweight metallurgy and multi-gear technology	they wanted a machine that would allow them to pedal into rugged terrain then inaccessible to cycles
1	the majority of the bikes never even make it into the high country	city dwellers love them because they shift smoothly in traffic bounce easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing bikes

1	new environmentalism is an emotional attack on proven methods of improving our quality of life and a bid for political power	let's rationalize our priorities by solving pollution problems at the local level as heretofore

1	yields on small-denomination certificates of deposit fell at about half the rate of so-called jumbo cds this week according to banxquote money markets an information service based here	investors can get slightly higher yields on deposits below $50 000 than they can on deposits of $90 000 and up
1	cd yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks	what happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit reported yesterday make it unlikely that short-term interest rates will rise any time soon
1	even before the market drop rates were down about half a percentage point	that puts pressure on cd rates
1	the volatility was dizzying for traders	the market must have turned up and down 15 different times
1	the market is still settling down after the recent correction	most of trading action now is from professional traders who are trying to take advantage of the price swings to turn a quick profit

1	that trend and wells fargo's heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs are about the only worries analysts have about wells fargo's financial picture	wells fargo is rebuilding its loan-loss reserve which increased to $711 million at sept. 30 from $664 million the previous quarter but was down from $852 million a year ago when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans
1	fees from syndicating loans dropped 48% to $21 million	we didn't take part in a lot of deals in the quarter

1	conservatives have an important decision to make this fall	at the recent meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund the bush administration announced its intention to decide by yearend the size of the next increase in the imf's capital base
1	the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase	this would be consistent with its unwavering support for the brady plan and g-7 exchange-rate intervention and with its financial commitment to mexico poland and others
1	third the imf would like to meet japan's request for increased ownership (currently 4.5%	japan has supported a larger role for the imf in developing-country debt issues and is an important financial resource for imf-guided programs in developing countries
1	on the other hand a decision to increase the imf's capital would reinforce the central economic role of multilateral institutions in developing countries	with the increase even more developing-country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning ministries that generate imf-approved economic plans
1	with the increase even more developing-country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning ministries that generate imf-approved economic plans	upping the ante could slow economic development even further as countries delay market-opening steps in anticipation of richer multilateral support
1	conservatives should take a position prior to the administration's year-end deadline	the issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase rather than its purpose
1	the b/t gene rearrangement test is more accurate than existing tests for diagnosing the type of cancer whether it has spread or whether there is a recurrence following treatment	the test initially will be used in conjunction with biopsies and other tests but eventually might become the benchmark for tumor analysis
1	the test is widely used in research centers but isn't having a major impact because it is only occasionally useful in choosing the most effective treatment.	we don't know yet how useful it's going to be
1	it isn't surprising that president bush hasn't led a crusade to pump up the contras or sdi	though he nominally supports both programs mr. bush hasn't been a passionate champion of either cause as mr. reagan was
1	and after the february election their future in any form will be murky at best	instead of focusing on the contras mr. bush has switched to urging members of congress to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of nicaragua's sandinista government
1	but the strong pitch by mr. cheney may be too little too late to prevent damage to sdi	the house has already voted for a deep cut in funding

1	trading in futures and options can add to volatility	investors believe they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks
1	these and other modern trading methods tend to promote dramatic shifts in assets	it's the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy
1	ual corp. is a good example	valued as a buy-out target the airline stock was trading at nearly $280 a share.
1	it closed at $198 yesterday	presumably ual is now trading closer to its value based on earnings
1	by contrast traditional buy-and-hold investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves	that for those who invest on fundamentals the value of a stock from day to day doesn't change all that much
1	the current volatility in u.s. markets pales in comparison to the 1930s decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced	i just can't believe that the innovations in the financial market are causing any of this volatility
1	that of the maxims of orthodox finance none surely is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity	it leads investors to focus on short-term price movements rather than on long-term fundamental valuation

1	we totally disagree	they have oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely off-base
1	it's also unnecessary	amateur spy-chaser clifford stoll is a real person or as he might waggishly put it a surreal person
1	one of them 25-year-old markus hess of hannover allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than 30 high-security computers in the u.s. searching for secrets	he probably didn't penetrate any top-secret files but the kgb in east berlin was willing to pay two of his associates peter carl and dirk brezinski $15 000 for some of the material hess collected
1	mr. stoll draws his title from the cuckoo's habit of laying eggs in the nests of other birds making them surrogate parents	the computer spy had discovered that a popular editing/electronic mail program called gnu-emacs could do tricks with the widely used unix operating system created by at&t.
1	back in berkeley he was violently scolded by a left-wing lady friend for consorting with such people	he became angry in return

1	this week was uneventful for the cd market	the major banks haven't even reacted to sharp rises in the three-month treasury bill rates in the past two weeks
1	the major banks haven't even reacted to sharp rises in the three-month treasury bill rates in the past two weeks	banks that adjusted payouts on cds in the most recent week made only fractional moves
1	typically banks offer cd yields higher than those on treasury bills which are considered the safest short-term investments	banks need a competitive edge to sell their products

1	i await his sequel: the economic and social resiliency of the san francisco bay area and the outstanding work of the local governments and the private charitable organizations there as metaphors for the supremacy of whatever failed system mr. cockburn now believes in	it should be a scream

1	but the issue is stickier than it seems	france britain and italy all have light tanks they would like to keep out of the talks
1	the soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks then argued for exempting some 4 000 russian planes because they are solely defensive.	the dispute over that issue according to one u.s. official is a potential treaty stopper and only president bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev may be able to resolve it
1	other nations aren't sure how many weapons they have in their own arsenals	it's just going to be sloppy both on our side and theirs {the warsaw pact's}
1	the bottom line is that if we can get that {warsaw pact} superiority brought down to parity we ought to keep pressing ahead as quickly as possible	about things becoming so unraveled on the other side that they might become unable to negotiate
1	it was all too mellow to be believed but they probably would have gotten away with it had they not felt compelled to add ms. collins's signature tune amazing grace and ask for audience participation	that went over the permissible line for warm and fuzzy feelings
1	mr. stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it	he warned us in advance that new york counterpoint lasts 11 1/2 minutes
1	it has been unfairly associated with other banks in new england that have had major loan losses in recent quarters	its people's savings bank unit doesn't have a large exposure to construction and commercial loans that have caused the loan-loss problems in many of the banks
1	the wall street journal is an excellent publication that i enjoy reading (and must read) daily	please make me and thousands of other readers more comfortable with our daily purchase of your newspaper by raising your environmental standards to your overall impeccable quality levels and increase your use of recycled paper
1	despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders	mr. gorbachev badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at home
1	mr. gorbachev badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at home	that a meeting with the leader of the u.s. could help bolster his stature among soviet politicians and academics whose support he needs
1	for his part mr. bush has been criticized regularly at home for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to mr. gorbachev's reforms and the historic moves away from communism in eastern europe	a face-to-face meeting with mr. gorbachev should damp such criticism though it will hardly eliminate it
1	that the december meeting which was announced simultaneously in moscow will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the fanfare and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers	by doing it in this manner we can have more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances things of that nature for public consumption
1	as the two sides plan to hold a full-scale summit in late spring-early summer next year they found it useful i would say even necessary to hold an interim informal meeting	although no specific agreements are expected that doesn't mean they will be without an agenda
1	that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the u.s. possibly at the 1990 summit	a trade agreement would give them most-favored nation status which would lower the tariffs on soviet exports to the u.s
1	in an unusually candid article about the latest economic woe -- unemployment -- pravda yesterday reported that three million soviets have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to 16 million by the year 2005	economists in moscow are now proposing that the state start a system of unemployment benefits
1	don't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation or arms control or the environment	those things will all come up but in a fairly informal way
1	one other issue the soviets are likely to want to raise is naval force reductions	that given the meeting's setting at sea gorbachev is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the navies of both the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact
1	one of the reasons bush administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering former president reagan's 1986 meeting with mr. gorbachev in reykjavik iceland	that meeting sent shivers through the western alliance because mr. reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting american allies
1	mr. bush decided he wanted the meeting after talking in europe in july with the leaders of poland and hungary who urged him to support mr. gorbachev's efforts to transform the soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on eastern europe	while flying home from those discussions mr. bush drafted a letter to mr. gorbachev suggesting an informal get-together to precede their formal summit next year
1	it is a very unhappy scene	it took zhao ziyang (former premier and party chief) 10 years to build a team of economists who understood how the western economies work and now that team is part in exile part being rusticated and part missing
1	and now that team is part in exile part being rusticated and part missing	rebuilding that team will take another 10 years
1	they are already industrialized	their problem is one of inefficiency of an industrial economy
1	if america can keep up the present situation -- her markets open for another 15 years with adjustments and japan can grow and not cut back and so too korea taiwan hong kong singapore asean australia and new zealand -- then in 15 years the economies of these countries would be totally restructured to be able to almost sustain growth by themselves	in such an arrangement all benefit
1	and if the europeans come in they benefit too	it's not a zero-sum game
1	i'm encouraged	the earlier strident notes struck by {u.s.
1	the u.s. is becoming more patient and circumspect	it's the total relationship that is important
1	japan's recent political turbulence may mean japan will slow market adjustments	they'll be more timorous in tackling their own voters like opening up more to agricultural imports from america hurting their farmers
1	what we have done is make it easier for the philippines to continue to host american bases without it being said they are lackeys of the imperialists and the only ones in asia or in southeast asia	we are willing to share the political burden of being host to america an imperial power

1	you can't say it's a tsunami (tidal wave) but we're making some headway	interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago
1	first they are safe	while they aren't backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government as treasury bonds are it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary
1	issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity	that's a headache for long-term investors since it forces them to reinvest their money
1	the company's turnaround is far from complete	many crucial tests are just beginning
1	the big one: a company's culture can't be radically changed unless top management first admits that things have gone badly awry and then publicly leads the charge	atsushi muramatsu nissan's executive vice president for finance helped set the tone in december 1986 when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a japanese auto maker since the nation's postwar recovery
1	no wonder	nissan japan's second-largest auto maker and the world's fourth-largest was getting beat up not only by its bigger rival toyota motor corp. but also by honda motor co. the most successful japanese car company in the u.s. but a relative pipsqueak in japan
1	the next level down did doors	if a new person got to work on part of the speedometer that was a big deal
1	this system produced boring boxy cars that consumers just weren't buying	desperately hoping to spark sales nissan transferred 5 000 middle managers and plant workers to dealerships
1	a year ago the company completely revamped its near-luxury sedan the $17 699 maxima which competes against a broad range of upscale sedans; it replaced its boxy pug-nosed body with sleek aerodynamic lines.	all three new models are outselling their predecessors by wide margins
1	all these vehicles have sharply improved nissan's morale and image -- but haven't done much for its market share	nissan had 29% of the japanese car market in 1980 before beginning a depressing eight-year slide that continued through last year
1	that continued through last year	strong sales so far this year are certain to turn the tide but even the 25% market share that nissan expects in 1989 will leave it far below its position at the beginning of the decade
1	nissan concedes that it won't recoup all its market-share losses in japan until at least 1995 and even that timetable might prove optimistic	everyone else is going to catch up with nissan's innovative designs
1	why	so far nissan's new-model successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential
1	nissan instead has kept its new stanza a bit smaller than that and cut the base price 6%	at $11 450 stanza prices start $749 below the predecessor model yet have a more-powerful engine
1	even if the new stanza succeeds nissan will remain behind in the subcompact segment where its sentra doesn't measure up to the honda civic and toyota corolla	nissan will introduce a completely revamped sentra next fall
1	the ads featured fences rocks and pussy-willow buds -- almost anything but the cars themselves	the ads have generated some laughs but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other u.s. auto advertising
1	that nissan is being prudent in following its slow-startup strategy instead of simply copying lexus	infiniti is nissan's big business move for the 21st century
1	these days nissan can afford that strategy even though profits aren't exactly robust	nissan had record net income of 114.63 billion yen ($868 million) in the fiscal year ended last march 31 a remarkable recovery from the 20.39 billion yen of two years earlier when the company lost money on operations
1	in its last fiscal year nissan's profit represented just 2.3% of sales compared with 4.3% at toyota	to help close the gap nissan recently established a top-level cost-cutting committee
1	nissan is the world's only auto maker currently building vehicles in all three of the world's key economic arenas -- the u.s. japan and europe	that gives it an enviable strategic advantage at least until its rivals catch up but also plenty of managerial headaches
1	already personnel officials are talking about the need for a phase two cultural-reform effort of some sort	we are still only half way through the turnaround of this company and there are many more things to do
1	west germany is contributing to imbalances in the world economy because of its success as an exporter	the solution is stronger domestic growth {in germany}
1	democrats had been negotiating with some republican congressional leaders on a compromise lately	with congressional elections next year gop leaders have worried about opposing a minimum-wage rise for low-paid workers at a time when congress is moving toward a capital-gains tax cut that would directly benefit wealthier taxpayers
1	with congressional elections next year gop leaders have worried about opposing a minimum-wage rise for low-paid workers at a time when congress is moving toward a capital-gains tax cut that would directly benefit wealthier taxpayers	republicans have been imploring the white house to compromise on the wage issue
1	mr. ridley's decision fires the starting pistol for perhaps a costly contest between the world's auto giants for britain's leading luxury-car maker	both general motors corp. and ford motor co. have been trying to amass 15% stakes in jaguar
1	but the government's action may scuttle the gm minority deal by forcing it to fight for all of jaguar	they (gm) will let ford have a free run
1	they (gm) will let ford have a free run	they will be going for a full bid
1	many investors certainly believe a bidding war is imminent	jaguar shares skyrocketed yesterday after mr. ridley's announcement following their temporary suspension on london's stock exchange
1	but it isn't clear how long gm would be willing to fight ford for jaguar	because of their longstanding rivalry gm just wants to make sure ford pays a huge packet for (jaguar
1	or there only may be one player in town	it is very hard to justify paying a silly price for jaguar if an out-and-out bidding war were to start now
1	its plans for jaguar would be more valuable in the long run than the initial windfalls investors might reap from a hostile ford bid	our intensive discussions with jaguar at their invitation have as their objectives to create a cooperative business relationship with jaguar that would provide for the continued independence of this great british car company to ensure a secure future for its employees and to provide an attractive long-term return for its shareholders
1	indeed the government is taking a calculated risk	mr. ridley's announcement set off a howl of protests from members of the opposition labor party who accused the thatcher administration of backing down on promised protection for a privatized company
1	it's now a very good time politically to get this over and done with	the government already buffeted by high interest rates and a slowing economy has been badly hurt by last week's shake-up in mrs. thatcher's cabinet
1	maybe he didn't start it but mohandas gandhi certainly provided a recognizable beginning to non-violent civil disobedience as we know it today	the mahatma or great souled one instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the british government in india
1	it is difficult however to justify civil disobedience non-violent or not where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change	where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it
1	they are useful to call public attention to grievances but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute	the delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted through bullhorns militant gestures accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics
1	the delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted through bullhorns militant gestures accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics	civilized discourse and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture abetted by superficial media interviews
1	demonstrations are particularly apt to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile	petty criminals and street people looking for excitement attach themselves like remora to the fringes of the crowd and use the protest as an excuse for rock throwing auto trashing arson window breaking looting pocket picking and general hooliganism
1	some find no harm in the misdemeanors of trespass minor property destruction blocking traffic and the like	these are small prices to pay for galvanizing action for the all-important cause
1	there is no way to get an ambulance in quickly to move him to a hospital	he dies
1	he dies	the demonstration was non-violent and involved only a simple misdemeanor but its impact on that individual was violent and terminal
1	the politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of rancor amid certain groups	in a planned protest against his appearance several members of the studio audience chain themselves in front of the tv cameras in such a way that the program cannot continue
1	in a planned protest against his appearance several members of the studio audience chain themselves in front of the tv cameras in such a way that the program cannot continue	the network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige
1	or maybe the tv network would lose nothing	geraldo or phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protesters
1	i am referring to those young men who chose to disobey their country's call to arms during the vietnam war and fled to canada or some other sanctuary to avoid combat	their cowardly acts of civil disobedience weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who served honorably in that conflict
1	even more at fault are those leaders in and out of government who urged and supported their defections thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy propagandists	it is amazing that the ensuing mass executions in vietnam and cambodia do not weight more heavily on minds so morally fine-tuned
1	give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law and no second invitation will be required	this brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations
1	in either case ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience	if you have not it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course
1	the law isn't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company's case	like any other creditor the pilots will have to apply to the court for payment of their claim
1	the company was disappointed by the ruling	the obligation is totally unwarranted
1	the pilots were extremely pleased	this is a blow not only to eastern but to the creditors committee
1	shortly after texas air took control of eastern some machinists union supervisors received a 20% pay raise	the pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them
1	the general public may not know his name but he's famous -- make that infamous -- in advertising circles	a marketing consultant he pioneered slashing ad agency commissions to the delight of advertising clients and the dismay of agencies
1	hiring mr. achenbaum is a shrewd move for backer spielvogel a unit of saatchi & saatchi	mr. achenbaum has counted among his clients some of the most visible blue-chip advertisers in the country including nissan toyota seagram and backer spielvogel clients hyundai and j.p. morgan
1	his client contacts meanwhile could prove a gold mine for an agency that has had few new business wins of late	i've done over 40 ad agency searches {for clients} so i have a pretty good notion of what clients are interested in when they look for an agency
1	mr. achenbaum's move follows the announcement last month that his consulting partner stanley canter 66 would retire	when the announcement came out i picked up the phone and said `why don't you come to us
1	he ultimately became so well-known for cutting compensation however that clients didn't seek him out for anything else	i was very frustrated
1	i was very frustrated	the fact of the matter is i am a marketer
1	the fact of the matter is i am a marketer	that's another reason {for the backer spielvogel job}
1	he will concentrate on among others j.p. morgan and hyundai	mr. achenbaum helped morgan in its recent agency search and he has a long relationship with hyundai which is having severe troubles including declining sales
1	the trail of revenue is increasingly going away from pure advertising and going towards other services	instead of being just an ad agency we have redefined our mission here

1	as in: you went ballooning??!! in france	americans have followed malcolm forbes's hot-air lead and taken to ballooning in a heady way
1	americans it seems have followed malcolm forbes's hot-air lead and taken to ballooning in a heady way	during the past 25 years the number of balloonists (those who have passed a federal aviation authority lighter-than-air test) have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand with some estimates running as high as 10 000
1	no wonder	we were coming down straight into their canal
1	we were coming down straight into their canal	see the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you can't steer
1	and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles an hour	when the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion
1	me nursing an espresso and my ego	a whole morning of ballooning and i had been off the ground barely 30 minutes

1	the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications	this clearly demonstrates that mips is a systems company rather than just a chip company

1	but it may amount to little more than posturing	the two have continued on-again off-again settlement talks over the last few weeks and people familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within a week
1	instead sony is likely to agree to let warner participate in certain of its businesses such as the record club of sony's cbs records unit	warner has surpassed sony as the largest record company but it doesn't have a powerful world-wide record club like cbs
1	but despite the acrimony between mr. ross and mr. yetnikoff officials of the time side of time warner have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities	time executives such as the company's president n.j. nicholas have no personal relationships or ego at stake in the fight over the guber-peters duo and were never directly drawn into the fray

1	the arrogance of a judge his demeanor the way he handles people are not a basis for filing a complaint	until this came up and hit the press there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong
1	the inquiry soon focused on the judge	even his routine business transactions caused trouble according to the grand jury report
1	when the judge bought his new sunbird from james e. black pontiac-cadillac in ebensburg five years ago the dealership had certain apprehensions about the judge's reputation according to the grand-jury report	the dealership took the extra step of having all the paper work for the transaction pre-approved by ebensburg's local lender laurel bank

1	the male part the anthers of the plant and the female the pistils of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other	the anthers in these plants are difficult to clip off
1	the laws of heredity dictate that half of the plants springing from these greenhouse-produced seeds will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible	the application of herbicide would kill off the male-fertile plants leaving a large field of male-sterile plants that can be cross-pollinated to produce hybrid seed

1	but in another sense the $846 million purchase is uncharacteristically nervy	the usually cautious giant will become the majority owner of the company that owns new york's beloved rockefeller center at a time when tensions over japanese purchases of u.s. property are at an all-time high
1	many japanese companies have taken the warnings by the country's leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties	mitsubishi estate's decision to buy into rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are irritated by the pressure to act for the good of japan

1	most were obtained with huge inputs of church money from south korea and japan minimum cash downpayments and sizable mortgages	those teams of young fund-raisers selling flowers peanuts or begging outright at traffic intersections brought in somewhere near $20 million a year during the mid-to-late 1970s but those revenues were a pittance compared to the costs of mr. moon's lavish international conferences speaking tours and assorted land buys
1	everything one non- moonie senior consultant to the unification church recently told me in an interview is going back to korea and japan	europe had proved even less hospitable than north america
1	(europe had proved even less hospitable than north america	european politicians were less reluctant to have their governments investigate and harass new religions

0	for example if wheat is being offered at $4.065 and bid at $4.060 a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price	that some floor brokers at the two largest chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers
0	investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it	suppose an investor wants to sell a stock but not for less than $55
0	once the price reaches that level a stop order turns into a market order and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get	stop orders are sometimes called stop-loss orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses

0	but the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms	new experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions
0	their experiments also produced large amounts of heat	the heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in
0	the results were fascinating	on the fourth run with the borrowed rod the experiment began producing excess heat
0	the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments' quiescent times as some scientists have suggested	there is a reality to the excess energy
0	they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time	the bursts often occur after they perturbed the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied or switching the current off and on
0	that they involve unusually meticulous measurements	typically the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt

0	like trying to buy life insurance for instance an endeavor notably lacking in dash	call it the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible
0	over the past decade or two the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products variations on products and variations on the variations	besides term life and whole life (the old standbys) we now have universal life universal variable life flexible adjustable universal life policies with persistency bonuses policies festooned with exotic riders living benefit policies and on and on
0	first generalize	shorn of all their riders special provisions and other bells and whistles insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories: so-called pure insurance which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death and permanent insurance which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive
0	if all you want is death-benefit coverage pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck within limits	it's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age
0	but term means just that	the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires
0	if you flunk you may not be able to buy it	even if you're healthy and can renew your premium will go up sharply because you're that much older
0	second the $5 760 i'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation	amex not i would get the benefit of the investment income on my money
0	which goes to show that the first law applies in insurance as in anything else	there is no free lunch there is only marketing
0	and in most cases a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is in effect paying the salesman's commission as well	investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years largely because of this
0	the simplest most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy	you pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing and your cash value and dividends grow over the years
0	hugely popular it is far more flexible than straight whole life	i can adjust the amount of insurance i want against the amount going into investment
0	i can adjust the amount of insurance i want against the amount going into investment	i can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year
0	so-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection	these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while i'm still alive
0	these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while i'm still alive	some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays
0	some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays	others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer heart attarcks renal failure and kidney transplants
0	i compared one universal policy for $130 000 face amount from such an insurer american life insurance corp. of lincoln neb. with a similar offering from equitable life assurance society of the u.s. which operates through 11 000 commissioned salesmen	after one year i could walk away from the ameritas policy with $792 but id get only $14 from the equitable
0	the difference is magnified by time too	at age 65 when i'd stop paying premiums the ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $14 000 higher than the other even though the equitable's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate

0	there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades	unlike mr. honecker mr. krenz enjoys asking questions
0	he was later shown on television fielding questions	at one point he asked a worker whether he thought east germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies
0	it's more than just travel	people have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society
0	this same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting u.s. congressmen this spring	rather than trying to lecture us says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting mr. krenz wanted to listen
0	rather than trying to lecture us mr. krenz wanted to listen	he was particularly impressed by mr. krenz's ready admission that east germany needed to change
0	but there's another side to mr. krenz	born in a baltic town in an area which is now part of poland he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus
0	he's a true reformer	even if he is he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the communist party's ruling politburo
0	but if he's sharp and quick he has a chance	that mr. krenz has several things going for him
0	that mr. krenz has several things going for him	the east german economy is strong compared with other east bloc nations

0	either he wasn't being real in the past or he isn't being real right now	either way i have a problem with how quickly he's changed

0	such caution was evident after the recent friday-the-13th stock market plunge	some bush administration officials urged mr. greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets

0	so far mr. greenspan's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well	his hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession
0	to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession	we've gotten through two stock market crashes and we've gone through an election without any major problems
0	but such caution is no guarantee against mistakes	the fed's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession perhaps starting early next year

0	mr. guber and mr. peters don't have much to gain from a protracted battle	sony for its part could decide that the cost of a warner settlement or court fight is too high choosing instead to find someone else to run columbia
0	but other murkier issues will play a big role	sony and the guber-peters team are hanging much of their case on warner's willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up

0	it's going to be a sensational thing says mr. krishnamurthy of p&g in bombay	says psyllium exporter mr. patel: i just got back yesterday from the u.s.
0	but the news of the boom has yet to trickle down to the farmers	they only know of one use for the crop as a laxative and with psyllium prices currently languishing in the wake of a bumper crop they think of the seed as a marginal crop something to grow between summer wheat crops
0	but there's a catch	sidhpur and adjacent districts are the only places in the world where psyllium is grown in large quantities
0	this is partly due to the particular demands of the crop	psyllium needs sandy soil dew during the first few weeks and then total dryness when its seeds are maturing
0	there are other spots on the globe and in india where the seed could be grown	it's not a crop that can't be doubled or tripled

0	that mr. lawson's tax cuts would have profound effects on britain's international accounts and the value of sterling	they increased the after-tax rate of return and made britain a far more attractive place to invest producing sudden capital inflows
0	so the british experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of albion	we had been soliciting opinions on it long before mr. lawson's resignation and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy john major
0	we should also add mr. lawson's own explanation as we understand it	unlike the u.s. britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages
0	unlike the u.s. britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages	the wage stickiness which oecd studies confirm is particularly high in britain gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation
0	unlike the u.s. britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages.	inflation is easier to spark and harder to control
0	perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates though of course in the event mr. lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound not restrain a strong one	that mr. roberts not only chides the chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling but also led the chorus saying that mr. volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise
0	in fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial for example and perhaps he picked the wrong pound-dm rate	for that matter perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency
0	for that matter perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency	we sympathize with mrs. thatcher's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of west germany
0	we sympathize with mrs. thatcher's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of west germany	perhaps the shock would have been less if they'd fixed to another low-tax deregulated supply-side economy
0	in particular shadowing a currency is anything but fixing	it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility
0	this cannot be solved by provoking a further downturn; reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation	our advice is this: immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money
0	as for california being a state run by liberal environmental loonies let's not forget where ronald reagan came from	perhaps mr. reagan who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees is the man you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the earth
0	your editorial was commendable and neatly matched by the readers' comments in letters to the editor alar: scaring on the side of caution	the illogic and inaccuracy of john h. adams's comments for the national resources defense council fully justifies your characterization of california's greens in particular as la-la activists
0	i have a different approach to offer not only to californians but to all americans	in a free country the law should restrict citizens as little as is consistent with good manners and public safety

0	the chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson resigned because prime minister thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser sir alan walters	the opposition labor party leader neil kinnock in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the british lower class denounced mrs. thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her cabinet
0	the opposition labor party leader neil kinnock in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the british lower class denounced mrs. thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her cabinet	the british press making a mountain out of a molehill precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying mrs. thatcher as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government
0	behind the silly posturing lies a real dispute	mr. lawson and his european-minded colleagues want the british pound formally tied to the west german mark.

0	the reason is simple	when a country cuts tax rates it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency
0	it was fear of disturbing ems exchange-rate relationships that caused the chirac government in france to be timid about cutting tax rates	edouard balladur the finance minister at the time was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-european for disturbing the linked european currency relationship
0	that after the top tax rate was cut to 40% the flow abroad of british capital slowed to 50 billion pounds ($79 billion at the current rate) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986	this change in the british capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency
0	the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of western financial circles during the 1980s	the most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates

0	to blend the methodical marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies	likely changes include more emphasis on research soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing
0	estee lauder inc. revlon inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives	cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times a year and since most products can be easily copied by competitors they're loath to test them with consumers
0	just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods it doesn't mean they are packaged goods	they're really fashion items wrapped up in little jars
0	unilever and p&g are the habitats of organization men in gray-flannel suits	both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research
0	both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research.	both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as soaps and diapers -- to the extent that some industry consultants predict cents-off coupons for mascara could result from their entry into the field
0	p&g already has shown it can meld some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the image-making of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business	consider oil of olay which p&g acquired as part of richardson-vicks international in 1985
0	goliaths like unilever and p&g have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals	next year noxell plans to roll out a perfume called navy
0	without p&g's backing noxell might not have been able to spend the estimated $5 million to $7 million needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands	packaged-goods companies will make it tougher for smaller people to remain competitive
0	further consolidations in the industry could follow	rumors that unilever is interested in acquiring schering-plough corp. 's maybelline unit are widespread
0	nearly 70% of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets according to andrew shore an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc	that figure has been inching up for several years
0	that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands	there will be more emphasis on quality
0	but success for unilever and p&g is far from guaranteed as shown by the many consumer-product companies that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business	in the 1970s several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies including colgate-palmolive co. eli lilly & co. pfizer inc. and schering-plough acquired cosmetics companies

0	the collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials	gov. george deukmejian called for an immediate investigation
0	the cypress structure opened in june 1957 and as such like many buildings in the san francisco bay area does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support	the northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits that were of a type to have liquefied easily during the 1906 quake
0	that at least at the federal level political ticket splitting has been on the rise over the past half century	in only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20% of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the white house than for the house of representatives.
0	as we know voters tend to favor republicans more in races for president than in those for congress	in every presidential election over the past half century except for the goldwater presidential candidacy the gop has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for congress
0	if these assumptions hold voters in races for congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner's dilemma and have an incentive at the margin to lean democratic	if they put a republican into office not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from bringing home the bacon to their respective constituencies
0	second it explains why voters hold congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives	any individual legislator's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency
0	the one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman republicans brought into office in 1980 by the reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982	because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the reagan revolution -- in national policy making they were more vulnerable to defeat
0	fourth the theory indicates why the republican party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office	potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a democratic opponent
0	fifth the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the south	to the extent that democratic legislators from the south have held a disproportionate share of power in congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies voters in the south have had an especially strong incentive to keep such democrats in office
0	finally the theory suggests why republicans generally have fared better in senate races than in campaigns for the house	since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of congress this is precisely the pattern one would expect if republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their democratic counterparts
0	this is indeed what the data indicate particularly in the case of the house	the democratic house attendance rate has not exceeded the republican house attendance rate since 1959
0	moreover ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level	state government is more typically split along republican-governor/democratic-legislature lines than the reverse

0	when they talk mega-issues they're truly talking mega	the capital market is booming
0	but the mega-issues are raising megaquestions about the rapidly evolving indian capital market	one is whether there is enough money to fund the new issues without depressing stock trading

0	some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first fruits of mr. gandhi's policy and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past	the industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the capital market which is a far cheaper source of funds than government-controlled banks where interest rates for prime borrowers are around 16%
0	the second factor spurring mega-issues is political	mr. gandhi has called general elections for november and many businessmen fear that he and his congress (i) party will lose
0	that some of the money raised in the current spate of issues will be used as campaign donations before the elections	but india's industrialists have a history of making under-the-table campaign donations

0	the story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s when a pediatrician named alfred g. knudson jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects	he theorized that in the eye cancer an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other
0	dr. knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome no. 13 from a parent who had had the disease	under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing
0	he believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple hits on cancer suppressor genes because it often seems to develop in stages	it often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages

0	america's war on the dictator over the past two years is the legacy of that relationship	before american foreign policy set out to destroy noriega it helped create him out of the crucible of panama's long history of conspirators and pirates
0	but u.s. intelligence rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy merely filed the report away.	from that point on the u.s. would make a practice of overlooking the panamanian's misadventures
0	in keeping with america's long history of propping up mr. noriega recent u.s. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival	mr. noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of panama's dire economic situation but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement
0	perhaps most important mr. noriega's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne	one colombian drug boss upon hearing in 1987 that gen. noriega was negotiating with the u.s. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name
0	his chief advantage in the fight: his intimate knowledge of american ways and weaknesses	mr. noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation

0	he was superb	noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people
0	during his years in chiriqui however mr. noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious	rodrigo miranda a local lawyer and human-rights monitor recalls an intoxicated noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th zone garrison headquarters in david where he had his offices.

0	but through this period so far as the u.s. military was concerned mr. noriega was a model recruit	he signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under american officers at fort gulick in panama in july 1967 according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details mr. noriega has since classified as secret

0	panamanian dictator torrijos he was told had granted the shah of iran asylum in panama as a favor to washington	mr. sanford was told mr. noriega's friend mr. wittgreen would be handling the shah's security
0	after prodding from mr. sanford u.s. attorney jack eskenazi pleaded with justice department officials in washington to let the indictment proceed	unfortunately mr. eskenazi wrote in a letter those of us in law enforcement in miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the united states but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control
0	during the reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the cubans and the sandinistas	he allegedly entered into panama's first formal business arrangement with colombian drug bosses according to floyd carlton a pilot who once worked for mr. noriega and who testified before the u.s. grand jury in miami that would ultimately indict the panamanian on drug charges
0	but mr. noriega was convinced the reagan white house wouldn't act against him because he had an insurance policy: his involvement with the contra rebels in nicaragua	the general allowed the contras to set up a secret training center in panama
0	although his help for the contra cause was limited it was enough to win him important protectors in the reagan administration	noriega played u.s. intelligence agencies and the u.s. government like a violin
0	an incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which mr. noriega might have maintained such influence with washington -- by compromising u.s. officials	curtin windsor then the ambassador to costa rica recalls being invited to panama by mr. noriega's brother luis carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and quiet serious conversation on the aswara peninsula
0	yet his political setbacks mounted	mr. noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of hugo spadafora his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger mr. noriega on drug trafficking charges
0	in late 1986 he made an offer he thought the u.s. couldn't refuse	mr. noriega offered to assassinate the sandinista leadership in exchange for a promise to help clean up noriega's image and a commitment to lift the {u.s.} ban on military sales to the panamanian defense forces
0	within weeks the unfolding iran-contra scandal took away mr. noriega's insurance policy	the death of cia director william casey and resignation of oliver north allowed anti-noriega political forces to gain influence

0	besides holding the promise of safer spinal surgery the probe could improve the diagnosis of brain and nerve disorders such as strokes and multiple sclerosis	perhaps most exciting the device is thrusting open a window to the workings of the brain
0	the probe which is painless non-invasive and apparently harmless employs strong magnetic fields to induce small whirlwinds of electricity within the brain	if positioned over the brain's motor-control area the hand-held electromagnets generate nerve impulses that zip down motor nerves and activate muscles making say a finger twitch

0	solo woodwind players have to be creative if they want to work a lot because their repertoire and audience appeal are limited	the oboist heinz holliger has taken a hard line about the problem: he commissions and splendidly interprets fearsome contemporary scores and does some conducting so he doesn't have to play the same mozart and strauss concertos over and over again
0	richard stoltzman has taken a gentler more audience-friendly approach	years ago he collaborated with the new music gurus peter serkin and fred sherry in the very countercultural chamber group tashi which won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like messiaen's quartet for the end of time
0	and now goes on the road with piano bass a slide show and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop with a few notable exceptions	just the thing for the vivaldi-at-brunch set the yuppie audience that has embraced new age as its very own easy listening

0	was this why some of the audience departed before or during the second half?	either way it was a pity
0	the rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by charlie parker ornette coleman bill douglas and eddie gomez with pictures for the douglas pieces	it was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke-filled club but like the first half much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable

0	it actually was the arguments of leaders within the soviet bloc itself that led the president to seek the december meeting	mr. bush decided he wanted the meeting after talking in europe in july with the leaders of poland and hungary who urged him to support mr. gorbachev's efforts to transform the soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on eastern europe

0	nissan helped develop a tokyo restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme	the chairs are s-cargo seats and a gift shop sells such items as alarm clocks styled like the pao's oversized speedometer
0	everyone else is going to catch up with nissan's innovative designs	nissan's pace of new-model hits will slow just as arch-rival toyota unleashes its own batch of new cars
0	nissan started advertising infiniti fully eight months before the cars hit american showrooms	the ads featured fences rocks and pussy-willow buds -- almost anything but the cars themselves
0	on the other hand nissan's sales goals for infiniti are modest compared with toyota's targets for lexus	nissan will build only about 3 500 of the $38 000 infiniti q45 sedans each month sending about 2 000 of them to the u.s. and keeping the rest for sale in japan.
0	infiniti is nissan's big business move for the 21st century and we're in no hurry to generate large profits right away	despite plans to add two new infiniti models next year bringing the total to four infiniti won't show profits for at least five years
0	nissan had record net income of 114.63 billion yen ($868 million) in the fiscal year ended last march 31 a remarkable recovery from the 20.39 billion yen of two years earlier when the company lost money on operations	nissan has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in japanese car sales
0	the big reason: for all its cost-cutting nissan remains less efficient than toyota	in its last fiscal year nissan's profit represented just 2.3% of sales compared with 4.3% at toyota
0	we are in a transitional phase from being a japanese company to becoming an international company based in japan	that nissan will soon establish a holding company overseeing all u.s. operations just as it's doing in europe

0	the agreement ended a long impasse between the congressional leaders and the white house over the wage issue	president bush in june vetoed a measure passed by congress and said he wouldn't accept any minimum-wage rise that went beyond limits he set early in this year's debate on the issue
0	the compromise was a somewhat softened version of what the white house had said it would accept	under the agreement with the house and senate leaders the minimum wage would rise from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.25 an hour by april 1991
0	the house is scheduled to vote this week on the compromise as a substitute to a new democratic bill itself watered down from last spring's version	the senate will probably vote not long afterward

0	both general motors corp. and ford motor co. have been trying to amass 15% stakes in jaguar	ford which already has an unwelcome 13.2% holding is prepared to bid for the entire company and had lobbied the government to lift the takeover restrictions early
0	jaguar shares skyrocketed yesterday after mr. ridley's announcement	in late trading the shares were up a whopping 122 pence ($1.93) -- a 16.3% gain -- to a record 869 pence on very heavy volume of 9.7 million shares
0	speculation about a takeover fight has sent jaguar shares soaring in the past six weeks	the share price was languishing at about 400 pence before ford's sept. 19 announcement of its interest in a minority stake
0	that ford now may be able to shut out general motors	it's either going to be a shootout or there only may be one player in town
0	in a statement jaguar's board said they were not consulted about the (ridley decision) in advance and were surprised at the action taken	the statement emphasized that holders representing 75% of the shares voting at a special shareholders' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions
0	that holders representing 75% of the shares voting at a special shareholders' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions	that ford as jaguar's largest shareholder now has the power to call for such a meeting
0	that ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid	jaguar's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened because fewer than 3% of its shares are owned by employees and management
0	the conservative government's decision may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election expected in late 1991	it's now a very good time politically to get this over and done with

0	mr. ridley hinted at this motive in answering questions from members of parliament after his announcement	he said he was giving up the golden share to clear the way so the playing field is level between all contestants
0	his policies went beyond his control and resulted . . . in riots and disturbances and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment	i am not a proponent of everything gandhi did but some of his law breaking was justified because india was then under occupation by a foreign power and indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally affected them
0	there may be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it	the case of rosa parks the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus comes to mind as an illustration
0	it is true that both are non-violent but there is a fundamental difference between them	lawful demonstrations such as peaceful picketing and other assemblages that do not disturb the peace or cause a public nuisance or interfere with the rights of others are rights guaranteed by any truly free system of government.
0	but before we get on with that let me make just a few tangential remarks about lawful demonstrations	they are useful to call public attention to grievances but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute
0	at best demonstrations are overused and boringly uninformative	at worst they can become the stimuli that lead to law breaking
0	soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in mob mania	there are better ways to promote a cause
0	assume a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involving a police car	the protesters lie down in the street blocking traffic and will not move until the authorities carry them away
0	assume that a tv network is airing a celebrity interview program with a live audience	the politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of rancor amid certain groups
0	the network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige	the demonstrators have been non-violent but the result of their trespasses has been to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with their dispute
0	geraldo or phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protesters	let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only harms other people indirectly yet does irreparable damage to the nation as a whole
0	let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only harms other people indirectly yet does irreparable damage to the nation as a whole	those young men who chose to disobey their country's call to arms during the vietnam war and fled to canada or some other sanctuary to avoid combat
0	to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage	give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law and no second invitation will be required
0	this brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations	do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause
0	here is a good rule of thumb: if the movement produced the leader the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement	in either case ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience

0	at backer spielvogel he will work with clients and potential clients on marketing strategies	aside from agency compensation issues he helped nissan for example come up with its positioning and pricing for its new infiniti line
0	i've done over 40 ad agency searches {for clients} so i have a pretty good notion of what clients are interested in when they look for an agency	as a consultant he has given seminars at agencies including ogilvy & mather on how to win new business
0	at backer spielvogel mr. spielvogel's hallmark has been personal involvement with all major clients	he pampers them; he invites them to fabulous parties; he strokes them
0	he pampers them	he invites them to fabulous parties
0	he pampers them; he invites them to fabulous parties	he strokes them
0	mr. achenbaum too delves into his clients' business	carl has a much higher degree of intimacy with his clients than is ordinary for an agency his size
0	ad agencies typically earned a straight 15% commission	if a client spent $100 million on tv time the agency made $15 million
0	that's another reason {for the backer spielvogel job	it struck me as a way to get back to what i really want to do
0	mr. achenbaum will work with clients to determine the mix of promotion merchandising publicity and other marketing outlets and to integrate those services	he will concentrate on among others j.p. morgan and hyundai

0	the clash is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in japan's once-cozy financial circles	not only are japan's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work
0	not only are japan's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work	increasingly they're squaring off against one another in unprecedented public fashion
0	what triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a new zealand government bond issue	nomura was attempting to organize the 50 billion-yen ($352 million) borrowing in japan at a time when many japanese banks led by industrial bank of japan were pressuring the wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by new zealand's civil-service pension fund.
0	new zealand's finance minister david caygill lashed out at such suggestions	he told reporters in wellington tuesday that the government hadn't guaranteed the loans to dfc new zealand ltd. an investment bank 80%-owned by the national provident fund and wouldn't bail it out.
0	no less significant than the japanese banks' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between japan securities and banking industries	anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the two industries from each other
0	in the past year both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses	nomura started a credit-card venture with american express co. that allowed cardholders to use their nomura securities accounts like a bank account attracting the wrath of banks.
0	but as the french embody a zen-like state of blase when it comes to athletics (try finding a nautilus machine in paris) my fellow conventioners were having none of it	the diners at my table simply lit more gauloises and scoffed at the suggestion of interrupting a perfectly good saturday morning to go golfing or even montgolfing (ballooning to you; the brothers montgolfier french of course were the world's first hot-air balloonists
0	during the past 25 years the number of balloonists (those who have passed a federal aviation authority lighter-than-air test) have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand with some estimates running as high as 10 000	some 30 balloon shows are held annually in the u.s. including the world's largest convocation of ersatz phineas foggs -- the nine-day albuquerque international balloon fiesta that attracts some 800 000 enthusiasts and more than 500 balloons some of which are fetchingly shaped to resemble carmen miranda garfield or a 12-story-high condom
0	but in epinal a gray 16th-century river town adjacent to france's vosges mountain region none of these yankee-come-lately enthusiasms for things aloft was evident	ballooning at the de rigueur hour of 6 a.m. held all the attraction for most people of sunrise root-canal work

0	after long stretches of this attendant ground activity came 20 or so lovely minutes of drifting above the vosges watching the silver mists rise off the river and the french cows amble about the fields	it's hard not to feel that god's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing out how belle it all was
