1	why can't we teach our children to read write and reckon it's not that we don't know how to because we do
1	the whole notion of creativity in education was (and is) part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction which was (and is) regarded as authoritarian a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful if as yet undefined potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children it is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive
1	fortunately these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood and they have enough common sense to know what that demands their commitment to creativity cannot survive adolescent illiteracy
1	but it is unfair to dump on teachers as distinct from the educational establishment and on the whole they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching
1	but our education proceeded at the hands of those others who were merely competent and conscientious in this sense a teacher can be compared to one's family doctor
1	in this sense a teacher can be compared to one's family doctor if he were brilliant he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place
1	our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity; it is not an educational problem
1	if we wish to be serious about american education we know exactly what to do -- and just as important what not to do there are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation some of them in the poorest of ghettos and they are all sending us the same message
1	conversely there are the majority of unsuccessful schools and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand we really do know all we need to know if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking
1	in this respect it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute rather than eloquently concerned they are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap
1	a comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need what gov. clinton is advocating in effect is extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years

1	locally elected school boards especially in our larger cities become the prey of ambitious generally corrupt and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians new york is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance
1	the new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers there is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures (in real terms) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century educational performance has declined

1	yields on five-year cds at major banks were averaging about 7.45% and 10-year treasury notes were paying less than 8% the cd seemed like a great deal
1	more important the cd was purchased on the secondary or resale market because the cd had an effective yield of 13.4% when it was issued in 1984 and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then part of the price dr. blumenfeld paid was a premium
1	dr. blumenfeld isn't unique especially at times like these when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect too many people chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk
1	it's not a blanket commitment it's a case-by-case situation there's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware of the risks

1	that's a lot of banishment as it turns out cfcs are the primary ingredient in a gas often referred to by the du pont trade name freon which is compressed to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment
1	but even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $100 billion between now and the year 2000 to convert to other coolants foaming agents and solvents and to redesign equipment for these less efficient substitutes the montreal protocol's legions of supporters say it is worth it that cfcs are damaging the earth's stratospheric ozone layer which screens out some of the sun's ultraviolet rays

1	the deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation carriers could use their equipment more efficiently
1	carriers could use their equipment more efficiently leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill shippers cut about $35 billion from their annual inter-city truck and rail costs to about $150 billion or about 6.4% of gross national product down from 8% of gnp in 1981
1	shippers are saying `the party's over shippers won't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years
1	shippers won't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years transport rates won't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy
1	we've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions now we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as carriers replace equipment pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor
1	less-than-truckload companies discounted away a 4.7% rate increase implemented last april the carriers were competing fiercely for market share
1	rate discounting in that industry has begun to stabilize consolidated freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3% late this year or early next year and at least two competitors have announced similar increases
1	import competition for u.s. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing working-girl mink and similar lower-priced imported furs in recent years merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher-priced furriers
1	merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher-priced furriers: the younger woman -- even in her late 20s -- who never thought she could buy a mink the new market helped boost u.s. fur sales to about $1.8 billion a year now triple the level in the late 1970s
1	many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made these imports haven't squeezed them
1	but low-priced and middle-priced furriers like mr. purnick say imports have cut their sales a woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a u.s.-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than $2 000
1	early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their american counterparts and were more open to innovation in 1982 he started a factory in greece
1	he also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur and he decided to follow suit by combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad he says he has been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost
1	and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the midwest small retailers who can't afford to travel to his new york showroom have become fair game
1	and those who didn't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages the intensive labor needed to manufacture furs {in the u.s.} is not as available as it was
1	you can't make a commodity out of a luxury that chasing consumers with low-priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs
1	whatever people want to buy i'll sell the name of the game is to move goods
1	those enterprises however are not going to be privatized they are officially considered strategic and their privatization is prohibited by the mexican constitution

1	in a speech prepared for delivery to london's financial community mr. lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the british economy using high interest rates as the essential instrument to carry out the campaign that rates will have to remain high for some time to come
1	that he would be watching exchange rates carefully a sinking pound makes imports more expensive

1	once you make up your mind about an investment the rest is easy right you just call your broker and say buy or sell
1	dream on there are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you don't know what you're doing
1	with a market order an investor tells a broker to buy or sell at the market it's like saying get me in now or get me out now
1	suppose an investor wants to sell a stock but not for less than $55 a limit order to sell could be entered at that price
1	stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level once the price reaches that level a stop order turns into a market order and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get
1	unlike stop orders stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price if it can't be made at that price it doesn't get filled
1	he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options i like to use them to feel out the market
1	this is really two orders in one generally for the same security or commodity instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order in a fast-moving market it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security
1	on oct. 19 1987 some investors learned the consequences of entering good-til-canceled limit orders and then forgetting about them they found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel
1	it is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are usually stuck with the consequences

1	but in this case the needle has a very sharp point though it's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent the fact remains that as one wag puts it anybody who can fog a mirror can call himself a financial planner
1	but in effect they operate in the dark there is no effective regulation of planners no accepted standard for admission into their ranks no way to assess their performance no way even to know how many of them there are
1	so it should come as no shock that the profession if that's what it is has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients' money alarmed state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners
1	industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards too they're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine
1	the danger to investors from incompetence is humongous far greater than that from crookery his group like others wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners
1	the best planner might be no planner at all for most investors the benefits just aren't worth the risks
1	but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it her group used to give tips on selecting planners -- check educational and experience credentials consult regulators and better business bureaus -- but found that even some people who took these steps were still getting ripped off
1	even the minority of them who must register with the securities and exchange commission as investment advisers have been enough to swamp the agency's capacity the sec has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in 1980 -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15 000 over the past decade
1	the sec has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in 1980 -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15 000 over the past decade currently a registered investment adviser can expect an sec audit only once every 12 years
1	a lot of bad things can happen in 12 years it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem
1	the most common conflict involves compensation that nearly 90% of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities insurance and other financial products they recommend
1	that nearly 90% of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities insurance and other financial products they recommend the issue: is the planner putting his clients into the best investments or the ones that garner the biggest commissions
1	in 1986 the new york attorney general's office got an order from a state court in albany shutting down first meridian corp. an albany financial-planning firm that had invested $55 million on behalf of nearly 1 000 investors in its notice of action the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into balanced investment portfolios; instead the attorney general alleged the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings coins and florida condos
1	the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings coins and florida condos those investments paid big commissions to first meridian payments investors were never told about
1	and first meridian's president roger v. sala portrayed himself as a financial expert when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma work as a real-estate and insurance salesman and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth first meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general
1	two such actions could be particularly embarrassing to the industry both name j. chandler peterson an atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the iafp as defendant

1	he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs the suit is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people
1	in many scams or alleged scams involving planners it's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm's way using it wouldn't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner
1	certificates of deposit don't pay 23% a year for example but that didn't give pause to clients of one alabama planner now they're losers and he's in jail in mobile county

1	the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation last week central intelligence agency director william webster publicly called on congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the u.s. more freedom to act in coups

1	one of the best deals though may mean skipping christmas dinner with the relatives this week many carriers are announcing cut-rate fares designed to get people to fly on some of the most hallowed -- and slowest -- days of the year including christmas

1	the meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research of the 1 300 chemists registered for the society's weeklong meeting fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week's end
1	the heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation they asserted that the excess heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod
1	his experiment was very erratic it would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times it would begin producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down
1	the bursts often occur after they perturbed the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied or switching the current off and on that some anomalous chemical reactions might be producing the heat
1	in subsequent experiments one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time they concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment
1	throughout the 1980s investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning capital has been democratized and people want in

1	amex said it would charge me $576 a year for $100 000 of coverage -- and would pay me back all the premiums i put in if i canceled the policy after 10 years sounds great -- or does it
1	third and most important amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount i'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that i'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile
1	i'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that i'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile that would be all right with amex which could then lock in its investment profit but it doesn't add up to a smart money move for me
1	this is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance the kind that amasses cash value the word death cannot be escaped entirely by the industry but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms preferring to talk about savings and investment instead
1	but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms preferring to talk about savings and investment instead the implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of cd or mutual-fund account with an added feature
1	that is gilding the lily the fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into
1	that's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package again no free lunch
1	one newer wrinkle has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy loans and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment
1	i'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately so i look into the broad category called universal life it is far more flexible than straight whole life
1	at a back-yard barbecue for example a friend boasts that she'll only have to pay premiums on her john hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be guaranteed i call her agent david dominici
1	insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise don't use commissioned salesmen there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial setup charges -- but i figure that the lack of commission and of surrender fees for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot
1	i'm thinking about using the $871 annual premium to finance a trip to paris first a person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there -- and shop for something more exciting while she's doing it
1	in east germany where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism they're not laughing about their new leader egon krenz mr. krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him
1	it was quite a shock for the first time in my life i wasn't sure whether i was listening to our news or west german television
1	and that's a problem mr. krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor mr. honecker but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising china for sending tanks against student demonstrators
1	against this background the new east german leader must move quickly to shore up his government's standing the sudden growth of the opposition movement together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through poland and hungary has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-soviet workers' uprising in 1953
1	the surge in production raises questions about capacity outpacing demand that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 when the current import trade restraint program ends which could result in more imports

1	hunt's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today's market depression while some 100 million ounces of silver once held by mr. hunt and middle eastern associates aren't hanging over the market anymore the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use
1	silver's history of volatility is also discouraging investors even in the present uncertain investment climate investors are preferring quality assets such as treasury bills and bonds to gold silver and platinum
1	the number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable a shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy
1	long-term support for the december contract was believed to be at $1.25 a pound there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract's price fell below it

1	why do people play the lottery when the odds are great against them people are shooting for a dream
1	at times salesmen may embellish the inside information with the notion that this is some slightly shady slightly illegal investment the person is being included in in appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others
1	that for many investors the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement once people got into it i was allowing them to live a dream
1	he phoned them with updates on the investment such as funny things that happened at the well that week you gave them some excitement that they didn't have in their lives
1	conservative appearances make people think it's a conservative investment people honestly lose money on risky investments that they didn't realize were a crapshoot
1	but hardly the only ones the scams promise -- among other things -- to help save the environment feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children
1	psychologists say isolated people who don't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud scam artists seek out such people -- or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves
1	that whatever a person's particular weak point timing is crucial people may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives
1	people may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives sometimes when people are making big changes retiring from their jobs moving to a new area they lose their bearings
1	sometimes when people are making big changes retiring from their jobs moving to a new area they lose their bearings they may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time

1	as hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another franchisers are struggling desperately for market share slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions the fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees
1	the chains used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow but in the last year or so discounting has become a 12-month thing though charisma's sales are up slightly this year mr. harty says profits will be flat or lower
1	with fast-food outlets on every corner he like many doesn't think he has a choice in the price war our customers say that they won't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon
1	if the battle continues much longer many fast-food businesses will close or merge the industry is overbuilt

1	quick-service restaurant units in the u.s. rose 14% to 131 146 between 1983 and 1987 the last year for which figures are available with the market so crowded if you're doing well you're doing well at someone else's expense
1	the prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties or portion of sales that they must pay franchisers
1	in any case many franchisees in order to stay on good terms with franchisers routinely go along with promotions if you resisted on prices maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise
1	but such tactics were alien to switzerland in 1976 eventually mr. rey was forced to sell his bally shares to the weapons maker oerlikon-buehrle holding ag as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the swiss old boys' network

1	for financial analysts reading omni's accounts is a tough challenge companies move in and out
1	in august omni unexpectedly bought inspectorate's 80% stake in harpener ag of west germany a land-rich company it makes sense for inspectorate-adia to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help

1	we're surprised we didn't think a sleeping {bell} mentality would be willing to take on dilution
1	but kenneth leon a telecommunications analyst with bear stearns & co. finds the bellsouth proposal still flawed because the company doesn't have to wait five years to begin buying more lin shares how many shares will be around in 1995

1	what we're seeing now makes a mockery of the idea of insurance: collect premiums from the healthy dump the sick and let them pay their own bills some lawmakers may seek legislation to limit overly restrictive insurance policies
1	to woo the small-business market as larger companies increasingly self-insure or use reserves to pay their own workers' medical bills the insurance industry has turned to the small-employer market that was once a backwater for them

1	ever since the link to cholesterol was disclosed americans have begun scarfing up psyllium in their breakfast cereals if further research proves the seed's benefits this dusty farm district could become the epicenter of a health-food fad to rival all fads since cod-liver oil
1	this seed's not grown anywhere else in india or anywhere else in the world the proper climatic conditions don't exist in many places in the world
1	only one thing is certain here: pysllium is likely to remain solely an export item from sidhpur for a long time local farmers say it is as good a cash crop as mustard or fenugreek a legume.
1	but some time ago researchers discovered that soluble fibers also lower cholesterol levels in the blood cincinnati-based p&g took an interest
1	cincinnati-based p&g took an interest it ordered two studies on psyllium and cholesterol
1	after 16 weeks the group that took three daily teaspoons of metamucil saw a significant dip in their general cholesterol levels and an even larger reduction in levels of low-density lipoproteins the so-called bad cholesterol in late 1987 p&g asked the fda for approval to market metamucil as the first non-prescription cholesterol-lowering product in the

1	psyllium's not a good crop you get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined

1	without quite grasping the implications of the research on cholesterol the council's annual report has psyllium on its last page lumped with such unglamorous export items as sarsaparilla and nux vomica a plant that induces vomiting

1	we're sorry to see nigel lawson's departure from the british government he is a politician with the courage of true conviction as in summarily sacking exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to 40%
1	british politicians divide into two groups of chickens those with their necks cut and those screaming the sky is falling so far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues: mr. lawson and sir alan walters the counterpoint of the chancellor's difficulties who also resigned as personal adviser to mrs. thatcher
1	in the british case mr. lawson is the closest thing in london to a supply-side globalist he not only slashed marginal tax rates initially sparking fresh growth in britain but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates indeed joining the european monetary system
1	at this point the options were: crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates as sir alan surely advised and forget the soaring pound to push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit a policy britain has repeatedly proved disastrous
1	but this devastated the u.s. manufacturing sector laying the seeds of protectionism mr. lawson though not allowed to join the ems chose to shadow the deutsche mark
1	mr. lawson though not allowed to join the ems chose to shadow the deutsche mark he reaped inflation along with rapid growth no doubt validating sir alan's predictions in the prime minister's mind
1	that mr. roberts not only chides the chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling but also led the chorus saying that mr. volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise somewhere in between there must be a golden mean perhaps measured by m-whatever but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity
1	that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus that the retirement of gilts for cash is equivalent to an expansionary open-market operation
1	all the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy better to have a true monetarist policy just for the experience
1	what mr. major and mrs. thatcher will do now remains to be seen they confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy that is to say stagflation
1	this cannot be solved by provoking a further downturn reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation
1	immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money this was the version of supply-side economics that in the late 1970s and early '80s worked in america and world-wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflicts britain today

1	until his resignation mr. lawson had been conducting british monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark when mrs. thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40% mr. lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark
1	with inflation surging the pound began falling against the mark to keep the exchange rate pegged mr. lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15%
1	this put mrs. thatcher in a bind the concept of european integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals the media and the imagination but are full of practical pitfalls
1	the price of attracting capital -- whether one's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit to avoid this deficit mr. lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise
1	consequently mr. lawson saddled mrs. thatcher with a record trade deficit renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row little wonder that mrs. thatcher's opponents were so anxious to keep mr. lawson in office
1	it is extraordinary that the british treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound the british balance-of-payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to 40% the flow abroad of british capital slowed to 50 billion pounds ($79 billion at the current rate) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986.
1	the most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates this has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle
1	britain and all of europe need to reconsider the prospects for european integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of germany a unified germany that remained within the western alliance would give germany such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified europe would become vassals of the german state

1	members of the audience gasped or laughed nervously their industry has been unsettled recently by acquisitions

1	p&g and unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout sparking fear though it is far from certain that companies best known for selling promise margarine and tide detergent will succeed in cosmetics there's little doubt they will shake up the industry
1	but some cosmetics-industry executives wonder whether techniques honed in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business estee lauder inc. revlon inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives
1	the moisturizer introduced in 1962 had a dowdy image oil of olay brought with it the baggage of being used basically by older women who had already aged
1	p&g set out to reposition the brand by broadening the product line to include facial cleansers and moisturizers for sensitive skin. the company says sales have soared
1	the presence of unilever and p&g is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics while the two are among the world's biggest advertisers most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads
1	the packaged-goods marketers may try filling that gap with a spate of new products unlike the old-line cosmetics houses unilever and p&g both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products
1	there will be more emphasis on quality you'll see fewer gimmicks

1	lloyd's is on the ropes it needs more discipline
1	many of the 31 329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange's most basic tenets the concept of unlimited personal liability investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe

1	that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process prosecutors not to seek forfeitures if there are less intrusive alternatives such as bonds and in any case not to seek forfeitures disproportionate to the defendant's crime
1	these changes come a tad late for princeton/newport the first ricoed securities firm it was forced into liquidation before trial when investors yanked their funds after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture

1	although external events have contributed to the morass the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs to reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits these programs can provide credit policy must:
1	for example legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds
1	for example student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that students' future earnings are not accepted as collateral the program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount
1	borrowers' incentives are equally skewed since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low
1	since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low. simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection (taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies) and to deny new credit to defaulters
1	simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection (taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies) and to deny new credit to defaulters these provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market imperfections
1	loan guarantees don't appear at all until the borrower defaults so new guarantees do not raise the deficit even though they create future liabilities for the government by converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit
1	by converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit predictably guarantees outstanding have risen by $130 billion since 1985 while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $30 billion
1	this figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private lenders to forecast losses or determined by selling loans to private owners (without federal guarantees) neither technique is perfect but both are better than the current system which misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $20 billion annually according to the congressional budget office
1	but both are better than the current system a budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what congress is committing them to
1	many agencies roll over their debt paying off delinquent loans by issuing new loans or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans in any case they avoid having to write off the loans
1	the administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits establishing these practices would permit earlier identification of emerging financial crises provide better information for loan sales and budgeting decisions and reduce fraud

1	that's really where the leverage hurt share prices performed even worse than the funds' asset values
1	in a typical leverage strategy a fund tries to capture the spread between what it costs to borrow and the higher return on the bonds it buys with the borrowed money if the market surges holders can make that much more profit

1	the success of the british gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law rather than the choice of gold for valuing the currency it is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914 when the bank of england was an independent private bank the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended but with the subsequent nationalization of the bank of england the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined
1	legal controversies in america have a way of assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case they speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment
1	it is what lawyers call fact intensive it presents no great issue of legal principle no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt

1	the local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons bashing the d.c. government is risk-free for members of congress
1	the morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex class race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of dr. morgan's particular situation it may stand as a metaphor for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence

1	researchers with business ties are more likely to falsify findings in order to tout new drugs as ties between academia and venture capital have blossomed in recent years governmental fear of abuse has risen
1	the amira transaction is typical of the way venture-capital firms are approaching the task of commercializing biotechnology research while universities develop the basic research venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its commercialization
1	in many of these deals venture capitalists had the inside track investors were willing to gamble on new technologies because we had exclusive rights to those technologies
1	but under the proposed guidelines all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work without the exclusivity most venture capitalists won't have the incentive to invest in such deals
1	the proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization -- and force small companies to waste scarce capital if start-ups can't have early access to research being conducted at institutions we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research
1	that its guidelines should not stifle research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use universities such as harvard and mit should be able to develop a way to act as brokers for the individual scientists

1	it's a tremendous disappointment allowing the epa to condone continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema to the environmental community

1	that a living person like mr. salinger had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man like mr. hubbard that salinger might by being taken in another factual context come back to haunt us
1	yet at the moment they are the judges who are making the law as matters stand the salinger ruling torn from context and broadly construed is controlling
1	as matters stand the salinger ruling torn from context and broadly construed is controlling if an author quotes more than minimal amounts of unpublished copyrighted materials as the salinger decision had it he deserves to be enjoined. the courts have not defined minimal amounts but publishers i understand take it to mean about 50 words
1	that when a writer uses quotation marks in reporting what someone has said the reader assumes that these are the speaker's precise words or at least his words purged of uh and you know and grammatical error while judges have an obligation under the first amendment to safeguard freedom of the press the right to deliberately alter quotations is not in my view a concomitant of a free press
1	these were only two of a series of fabrications that had in judge kozinski's words the cumulative effect of making mr. masson appear more arrogant less sensitive shallower more self-aggrandizing and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements as robert coles wrote in a review of ms. malcolm's book mr. masson emerges as a grandiose egotist . . . and in the end a self-destructive fool.

1	conner's performance is closely tied to the burgeoning demand for battery-operated computers the computer industry's fastest-growing segment since its inception conner has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to 10 times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines
1	in the coming months however this is likely to change next month seagate technology plans to introduce its first family of low-power drives for battery-operated computers

1	in making malcolm and nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation ms. zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters the humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts (even the characters' own) are likely to bleed for the plight of health-food eaters

1	it's a super-exciting set of discoveries only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level
1	scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors or simply anti-cancer genes when functioning normally they make proteins that hold a cell's growth in check
1	so for cancer to arise both copies must be impaired a person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene or in whom one copy is damaged early in life is especially prone to cancer
1	the dedham mass. couple knew even before bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a 50% chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma he carried a damaged gene having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old
1	that little will quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and therefore faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer it made our new year
1	the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes alone or in combination appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain the skin kidney prostate and cervix that if people inherit defective versions of these genes they are especially prone to cancer perhaps explaining finally why some cancers seem to haunt certain families
1	under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing he assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer

1	if both copies of a second gene were then deleted the polyps would progress to malignancy it was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop
1	their report galvanized other molecular biologists it was the confirming evidence we all needed that {gene} losses were critical to the development of a common tumor
1	they focused on chromosome 17 for months the johns hopkins researchers using gene probes experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17 looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells
1	for months the johns hopkins researchers using gene probes experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17 looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells such a piece of dna would probably constitute a gene

1	for the past decade nec corp. has owned more than half the japanese pc market and ruled it with near-monopoly power with little competition the computer industry here is inefficient
1	but early on ibm offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it dozens of small companies did swiftly establishing a standard operating system
1	nec won't release its code and every one of the dozen or so makers has its own proprietary operating system but nec was ahead from the start and didn't need to invite in competitive allies
1	most rivals have a working relationship with nec often through cross-licensing of technology they hesitate to market nec-compatible machines
1	they hesitate to market nec-compatible machines nec disapproves of such machines and marketing one would jeopardize their relationship
1	because nec is enjoying a monopoly there are no price wars no competition

1	in a country where elbow room is scarce laptop machines will take a large portion of the industry's future growth toshiba corp. busted open that sector this summer with a notebook-sized machine that retails for less than 200 000 yen

1	sen. strom thurmond (r. s.c.) recently urged fellow lawmakers to revive a broad federal death penalty the ultimate punishment will protect the law-abiding from the vicious cruel individuals who commit these crimes
1	the law that sen. thurmond is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the maryland restaurant murders and almost all other killings most murders are state crimes
1	for one thing it's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences let alone be executed most of the crimes incorporated in the thurmond bill are exceedingly rare
1	that burden is very difficult if not impossible to meet how do you prove a negative
1	how do you prove a negative since most prosecutors wouldn't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations didn't affect sentencing executions everywhere might come to a halt

1	the nissan logo flashed on the screen for a moment and then came a taped plea for donations from former president reagan -- followed by the silent print telling viewers where to call within two hours viewers pledged over $400 000 according to a red cross executive

1	at nissan we felt we wanted to do something to help them gather money and we had this airtime on monday night football what did we get out of it
1	but as advertisers latch onto disasters with increasing frequency they risk hurting themselves as much as helping the cause they chance alienating the customers they hope to woo by looking like opportunistic sharks
1	it can backfire because companies can step across the line and go too far be too pushy the ultimate form of charity is when you don't tell anyone

1	the soviets have a world-leading space program wouldn't the japanese like a piece of it
1	the sales pitch mightn't be as farfetched as it seems japan-u.s. trade relations are bumpy these days and some japanese favor decreasing their reliance on u.s. technology in light of the fsx fighter-plane flap when u.s. officials reversed an earlier decision and refused to share certain crucial fighter-plane technology
1	they believe technology is one of their best bets the soviets held export exhibitions that included high-tech items in new york and west germany
1	but they also hope to benefit from japanese manufacturing expertise the soviet union has a lot of know-how but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy

1	nearly 10 years ago representatives of service-sector companies worked out a plan with the commerce department to improve the data on service-sector exports both groups believed that tens of billions of dollars of service exports were not being counted as exports
1	these revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar the materially smaller trade deficit may have been already discounted in the market
1	too early to tell but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture it does not relieve the need for our market-opening efforts for both goods and services but it does suggest that it is our exports of services and not just borrowing that is financing our imports of goods

1	the closeness of soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of mussolini was evident when mr. gorbachev presented his economic vision to the soviet congress in doing so he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market
1	mr. gorbachev is in a much stronger position to pursue the corporatist ideal than was mussolini the soviet communist party has the power to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it
1	at the same time he must give it sufficient freedom to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed it is the promise of economic returns that is supposed to make the corporatist model attractive to both the party and labor
1	at the same time the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine western-style political pluralism the most important development in mr. gorbachev's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the u.s.s.r. also suffers from terrorism
1	an increasing number of references by the soviet press to opposition groups now active in the u.s.s.r. particularly the democratic union allege that they show terroristic tendencies and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims it is possible that in perpetuating such myths the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism
1	mr. gorbachev would appear to see his central task however as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo if he were able to construct a popular and efficient corporatist system he or his heir would be wellplaced to rein in political opposition and to re-establish control in eastern europe
1	the weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations but in its economic prescription contrary to widespread belief mussolini failed to live up to his promise to make the trains run on time

1	one of the reasons bush administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering former president reagan's 1986 meeting with mr. gorbachev in reykjavik iceland that meeting sent shivers through the western alliance because mr. reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting american allies

1	the big one: a company's culture can't be radically changed unless top management first admits that things have gone badly awry and then publicly leads the charge atsushi muramatsu nissan's executive vice president for finance helped set the tone in december 1986 when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a japanese auto maker since the nation's postwar recovery
1	no wonder nissan japan's second-largest auto maker and the world's fourth-largest was getting beat up not only by its bigger rival toyota motor corp. but also by honda motor co. the most successful japanese car company in the u.s. but a relative pipsqueak in japan

1	all these vehicles have sharply improved nissan's morale and image -- but haven't done much for its market share nissan had 29% of the japanese car market in 1980 before beginning a depressing eight-year slide that continued through last year
1	that continued through last year strong sales so far this year are certain to turn the tide but even the 25% market share that nissan expects in 1989 will leave it far below its position at the beginning of the decade
1	nissan concedes that it won't recoup all its market-share losses in japan until at least 1995 and even that timetable might prove optimistic everyone else is going to catch up with nissan's innovative designs
1	why so far nissan's new-model successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential
1	nissan instead has kept its new stanza a bit smaller than that and cut the base price 6% at $11 450 stanza prices start $749 below the predecessor model yet have a more-powerful engine

3	if you're still wondering about the causes of the slump in the junk-bond market consider the case of columbia savings & loan the california thrift has just announced a $226 million third-quarter loss
3	now we regard this as a largely phony issue but the long term is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the beltway it turns out that columbia had this huge loss in large part because the new congressionally mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its soon-to-be-sold junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value
3	congress's ham-handed treatment of the existing structure of junk-bond holdings reminds us of a story in the journal earlier this year about the baby bell companies' desire to have the court-ordered bans lifted on offering information services the issue of seeking relief from congress was raised to delbert staley the chairman of nynex.

3	in broadest terms stability has quietly settled into international oil markets mideast politics have calmed down and the squabbling within the organization of petroleum exporting countries seems under control for now
3	the fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices after years of wild swings oil prices over the last 12 months have settled at around $15 to $20 a barrel
3	not that oil suddenly is a sure thing again the current equilibrium is fragile and depends on steady strong demand and continued relative harmony within opec

3	about a year ago it ended an on-again off-again internal production war that had put prices on a roller coaster and pitched oil towns from houston to caracas into recession saudi arabia opec's kingpin abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish quota-cheaters
3	in addition global petroleum demand has been climbing it is projected to keep growing by a million barrels a day or up to 2% annually for years to come
3	to promote this balance opec now is finally confronting a long-simmering internal problem at its november meeting it will try to revise its quotas to satisfy persian gulf members that can produce far more oil than their allotments
3	that would send prices plummeting from what some gun-shy u.s. oil executives still regard as too low a level patrick j. early president of amoco corp. 's oil-production unit says that despite recent stability he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending

3	albert engelken and robert thomson had never met though for 38 years their lives had been intertwined in a way peculiar to the sports world mr. engelken and mr. thomson hadn't even talked to each other
3	he often groans at the clutter of sports stories about drugs alcohol gambling and some player's lament about the miserly millions he is offered to play the game his morning paper the washington post even carries a sports column called jurisprudence that recounts the latest arrests and convictions of players and team managers
3	the rest as they say is history mr. thomson a tall scottish-born right-hand hitter stepped into the batter's box
3	mr. engelken and mr. thomson drifted in different directions in the subsequent years mr. thomson played outfield and third base until 1960 posting a lifetime .270 batting average and chalking up 264 home runs before retiring and going into paper-goods sales.
3	mr. engelken moved south to washington but he took with him enduring memories of the homer of 1951 when his wife betsy came down the aisle on their wedding day in 1966 mr. engelken -- no slouch on the romantic front -- gave her the ultimate compliment: you look prettier than bobby thomson's home run
3	when his wife betsy came down the aisle on their wedding day in 1966 mr. engelken -- no slouch on the romantic front -- gave her the ultimate compliment: you look prettier than bobby thomson's home run the couple's first dog homer was named after the great event
3	mrs. engelken had scheduled a stop on the new jersey turnpike to she told her husband pick up some papers for a neighbor the papers would be handed over at a bank of telephone booths just off exit 10
3	and there he was the hero of my youth the one person in history i'd most like to meet
3	they talked of the home run i thought it was in the upper deck said bobby thomson now 66 years old
3	they talked of the aftermath i never thought it would become so momentous bobby remarked
3	mr. engelken was overwhelmed by the whole thing it was worth it just for the look on albert's face
3	the two men spent an hour at exit 10 rehashing the event fulfilling the lifelong dream of a young boy now turned 50 his hero signed photographs of the homer and diplomatically called ralph branca a very fine pitcher
3	but his fans to his constant amazement never let him forget the famous four-bagger his mail regularly recalls my one event and has been growing in recent years
3	i don't know how much got through nobody has any credible estimate
3	i welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the drug problem the efforts to get to the people who are addicted try to rehabilitate them; if they cannot be rehabilitated at least to contain them; to educate people to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users to stop this process among the young -- all of these things i think are extremely important
3	the conceptual base -- a criminal-justice approach -- is the same that i have worked through before we designed a comprehensive program and we worked hard on it
3	in the reagan administration we designed a comprehensive program; we worked very hard on it our international efforts were far greater than ever before
3	these efforts wind up creating a market where the price vastly exceeds the cost with these incentives demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it
3	when you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives including i might say the incentive that the drug pushers have to go around and get kids addicted so that they create a market for themselves they won't have that incentive because they won't have that market
3	i find it very difficult to say that sometimes at a reception or cocktail party i advance these views and people head for somebody else
3	the bugs won't delay their development of 486-based machines we haven't modified our schedules in any way

3	the real culprits are computer makers such as ibm that have jumped the gun to unveil 486-based products the reason this is getting so much visibility is that some started shipping and announced early availability

3	and the critics include some of the country's most successful investors warren buffett has been on record as opposing stock-index futures since their inception in 1982
3	essentially the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps one group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market's basic function of raising capital
3	that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market's basic function of raising capital before futures you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing you were buying had any intrinsic value
3	it's too disruptive it isn't investing
3	but stock-index futures have plenty of support defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks
3	defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks they note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures
3	that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s a decade before the advent of futures futures merely cut down on trading costs
3	either you adapt or die if futures aren't permitted here we'll take it to australia or tokyo
3	one reason futures are said to add volatility is that people can speculate in futures with little money down margin requirements for speculators on the chicago mercantile exchange are currently about 7%
3	but owning index futures isn't the same as owning the underlying stocks stockholders as a group can win because they own a share of corporate earnings which can grow and boost stock prices
3	you don't own anything you're making a pure bet on the market
3	accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments
3	if you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return i would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk as i am sure your pros do your hypothetical investor is simply being compensated for taking on this added risk
3	this means the returns can vary a great deal mr. dorfman provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your staff of dart throwers would have accumulated only $112 383 by randomly selecting four new stocks to be held in a portfolio each month

3	that as much as 67% of corporate-owned land is held by 403 companies -- and that as little as 1.5% of that is used for business that in the first half of 1989 the nation's 30 largest business groups bought real estate valued at $1.5 billion

3	the warning by the u.s. attorney's office follows two decisions by the u.s. supreme court last june in those cases the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment
3	according to individuals familiar with mr. antar's case prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of mr. antar's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure in a letter prosecutors told mr. antar's lawyers that because of the recent supreme court rulings they could expect that any fees collected from mr. antar may be seized
3	in a letter prosecutors told mr. antar's lawyers that because of the recent supreme court rulings they could expect that any fees collected from mr. antar may be seized prosecutors have told mr. antar's attorneys that they believe mr. antar's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities.
3	mr. antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in newark by the securities and exchange commission in that suit the sec accused mr. antar of engaging in a massive financial fraud to overstate the earnings of crazy eddie edison n.j. over a three-year period
3	that mr. antar aimed to pump up the company's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits mr. antar made more than $60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987
3	that the government's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly according to department policy prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made
3	but the broader truth is more complicated -- and dismaying the policy was contained in an exchange of letters last october between the senate intelligence committee and the cia and national security council.
3	they simply got carried away with interpreting what the executive order banning assassinations really meant mr. boren himself didn't discover the warn-your-enemy nuance until mr. bush told him privately at the white house last week

3	but he does concede that congress has made mistakes in the aftermath of vietnam in the aftermath of iran-contra i can understand some people might think that if they plan a coup they have to bring their lawyers he says
3	the sustainability of u.s. foreign policy is essential why was containment so successful?
3	mr. boren even spies a silver lining he figures the episode will help clarify any ambiguities between the committee and administration
3	more broadly mr. boren hopes that panama will shock washington out of its fear of using military power maybe this will jolt us out of the post-vietnam syndrome that we never are prepared to use force he says
3	the problem goes beyond legal interpretation maybe the problem is a political system that won't act without an exchange of letters
3	the new contract essential to the revival of the hong kong futures exchange that without a healthy futures exchange hong kong's aspirations to be recognized as an international financial center will suffer
3	the contract will be based on the three-month hong kong interbank offered rate or hibor it is almost a carbon copy of the chicago mercantile exchange's eurodollar contract which is based on the three-month eurodollar rate the rate paid on u.s.-dollar deposits in london banks
3	if the contract is as successful as some expect it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in hong kong the contract is definitely important to the exchange

3	the complex bill covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the commodity futures trading commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated these include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders and exchange governance
3	one of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker the new york futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill
3	today trading in almost any commodity can be diverted from u.s. markets with just a few strokes of a keyboard all foreign markets are aggressively courting u.s. business

3	it's not that we don't know how to because we do it's that we don't want to
3	and the reason we don't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular as well as to violate some cherished vested interests these beliefs so dominate our educational establishment our media our politicians and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them

3	agreement disapproval boredom and distraction all can be inferred from the subjects' twist of a dial in another experiment an elaborate chart with color codes reveals how people's opinions were shaped -- and how they can be reshaped
3	donald vinson who oversees the experiments isn't some white-coated researcher he heads litigation sciences inc. the nation's largest legal consulting firm
3	little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within litigation sciences a unit of saatchi & saatchi plc employs more than 100 psychologists sociologists marketers graphic artists and technicians twenty-one of its workers are ph.
3	recently litigation sciences helped pennzoil co. win a $10.5 billion jury verdict against texaco inc it advised the national football league in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the united states football league
3	largely as a result litigation sciences has more than doubled in size in the past two years its 1988 revenue was $25 million
3	and memorialized on the movie screen in the film classic twelve angry men the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict
3	litigation consulting is highly manipulative the notion they try to sell is that juries don't make decisions rationally
3	that consultants can be very effective it's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough it's almost malpractice not to use them
3	sophisticated trial consulting grew ironically from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases the harrisburg 7 trial in 1972 in which daniel berrigan and others were charged with plotting anti-war-related violence was a landmark
3	in that case a group of left-leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around harrisburg the researchers discovered that episcopalians presbyterians methodists and fundamantalist protestants were nearly always against the defendants
3	ultimately that carefully picked jury deadlocked with a 10-2 vote to acquit and the prosecution decided not to retry the case litigation consulting had arrived
3	thus the shadow jury was born mr. vinson the professor got the law bug and formed litigation sciences
3	mr. vinson the professor got the law bug and formed litigation sciences ibm won the case
3	just before the actual closing arguments the firm put the case to a vote of the five shadow jurors each of whom was being paid $150 a day the jurors who didn't know which side had retained them decided for energy transportation and awarded $500 million in damages
3	it's just like weather forecasting it's often wrong but it's better than consulting an indian rain dancer
3	if it is a case in which the client seeks punitive damages for example depressed underemployed people are far more likely to grant them someone with a master's degree in classical arts who works in a deli would be ideal
3	for personal-injury cases litigation sciences seeks defense jurors who believe that most people including victims get what they deserve such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the physically handicapped the poor blacks and women
3	we don't control the facts they are what they are
3	once a jury is selected the consultants often continue to determine what the jurors' attitudes are likely to be and help shape the lawyers' presentation accordingly logic plays a minimal role here
3	logic plays a minimal role here more important are what lsi calls psychological anchors -- a few focal points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level
3	by repeatedly drawing the jury's attention to the arm the defense lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman's injuries the ploy worked
3	in a classic defense of a personal-injury case the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame the ideal defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the jurors to hold the accident victim responsible for his or her plight
3	that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it visually computer-generated videos help
3	lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics
3	but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics they may not have been able to articulate it all but they did it
3	they may not have been able to articulate it all but they did it what you have here is intuition made manifest
3	many lawyers maintain that all's fair in the adversary system as long as no one tampers with the evidence others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment -- and used that to advantage
3	litigation sciences concedes that in one in 20 cases it was flatout wrong in its predictions a few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched by consultants or of overpriced services
3	some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick the essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation says barry ostrager of simpson thacher & bartlett who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against shell oil co
3	even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact mr. boies the first lawyer to use mr. vinson's services cautions against courts' allowing extensive jury questioning (known as voir dire) or giving out personal information about the jurors

3	in reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound mr. lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy he monitors the money-supply figures but doesn't give them paramount importance as some private and government economists have suggested
3	despite the increase the british currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week it was quoted at 2.9428 marks in late new york trading wednesday
3	leading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the british war on inflation will be more bruising than previously assumed unemployment in september dropped to 1 695 000 the lowest level since 1980
3	that demand pressures were even more buoyant than had been appreciated when the british economy was heating up last year that there's no quick-fix solution to the economic woes
3	discussing the recent slide in stock prices the central bank governor stated that the markets now appear to have steadied after the nasty jolt of the 190.58-point plunge in the dow jones industrial average a week ago although the new york market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the london financial times-stock exchange 100 share index mr. leigh-pemberton declared that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the british economy
3	so here's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges two things to keep in mind
3	two things to keep in mind not all exchanges accept every type of order
3	for example if wheat is being offered at $4.065 and bid at $4.060 a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price that some floor brokers at the two largest chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers
3	investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it suppose an investor wants to sell a stock but not for less than $55
3	once the price reaches that level a stop order turns into a market order and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get stop orders are sometimes called stop-loss orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses
3	while stop orders sound similar to limit orders there is a difference sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above.
3	the crash in october 1987 and last friday's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and won't do an investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $90 under a stock that was trading at $100 a share on the friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $75 when the stock opened at that price on monday
3	the fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades it instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better
3	i like to use them to feel out the market if they don't fill it immediately then i can start over at a new price or try again with the same price
3	this is another timing order it is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment if they think they can get a better price by waiting
3	this type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time on the close can be added to many types of orders
3	stop-close-only orders are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading day orders expire at the end of the day on which they are entered good-till-canceled orders have no expiration date
3	it is the right-wing guerrillas who are aligned with the drug traffickers not the left wing this information was gleaned from your own news stories on the region
3	i suggest that the wall street journal should put its money where its mouth is lend computer equipment to replace that damaged at el espectador buy ad space publish stories under the bylines of el espectador journalists

3	there is no effective regulation of planners no accepted standard for admission into their ranks no way to assess their performance no way even to know how many of them there are all anyone need do is hang up a shingle and start planning
3	alarmed state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards too
3	but reform hasn't taken hold yet the industry is still pretty much in its wild west days
3	an admittedly limited survey by nasaa found that between 1986 and 1988 fraud and abuse by financial planners cost 22 000 investors $400 million the rogues' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons a compulsive gambler or two various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy and one man who scammed his wife's grandmother
3	so do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners nobody can estimate the toll but john gargan a tampa fla. planner and head of one trade group the international association of registered financial planners thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is humongous far greater than that from crookery
3	and the pool of capital they influence is enormous a survey of 54 000 of them conducted by the iafp in april showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of $154 billion of their clients' money in the previous 12 months
3	the sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult if not impossible to regulate even the minority of them who must register with the securities and exchange commission as investment advisers have been enough to swamp the agency's capacity
3	the proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with mr. schwartz the puckish planner from englewood colo. says that allowing the business to police itself would be like putting dracula in charge of the blood bank
3	mr. when the iafp recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners mr. gargan's group was excluded
3	the states have their own ideas about regulation and certification nasaa the organization of state securities regulators is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states

3	that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices with plush furnishings when we go there it's quite different from these hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses
3	the newport beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately the case of matthew valentine who is currently serving a six-year sentence at lompoc federal prison for his role in intech investment corp. which promised investors returns of as much as 625% on precious metals

3	with the $3 million received from investors he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive bmw for his girlfriend whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits it's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose out to the dog track or to the tables in las vegas

3	since president bush disclosed them privately to seven republican senators at a white house meeting last monday mr. bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month's futile effort to oust panamanian dictator manuel noriega
3	the notification requirement didn't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month's panama coup effort no notification was ever considered
3	that are being rewritten by the panel and the white house the rewriting was launched at a meeting between mr. bush and intelligence committee leaders oct. 12
3	however the disclosure of the guidelines is already being interpreted on capitol hill as an unfair effort to pressure congress it has reopened the bitter wrangling between the white house and congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust mr. noriega
3	that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in panama someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government
3	in fact yesterday the administration and congress were still differing on what had been agreed to one administration official said notification was required even if the u.s. gets wind of somebody else's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator's life
3	that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of u.s. intelligence and military operatives in panama it could make u.s. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble

3	one of the plan's authors has defended the socioeconomic disadvantage category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race perhaps it does
3	but the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms new experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions
3	their experiments also produced large amounts of heat the heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in
3	the results were fascinating on the fourth run with the borrowed rod the experiment began producing excess heat
3	the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments' quiescent times as some scientists have suggested there is a reality to the excess energy
3	they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time the bursts often occur after they perturbed the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied or switching the current off and on
3	that they involve unusually meticulous measurements typically the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt
3	one exception is a continuing experiment at stanford university where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells a cell filled with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it
3	so throughout the decade i have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and cds and tinkered with stocks bonds and mutual funds as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative
3	figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses i've invested in during this prosperous decade oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until i divested myself of all such stocks in 1985 at which point the industry while not lighting up any christmas trees began a slow recovery
3	but here in figure 2 is where i've chosen to build for the future: personal space; automotive pursuits; children's toys; gardening equipment bulbs and shrubs; and finally entertainment perhaps the best investment of all all have paid off for me in double-digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential
3	continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy (figure 5) with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60% of the car's original value according to my calculations these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $22 000 on the open market
3	i have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers my initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold according to my conservative calculations
3	with this personal strategy firmly in place i look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage my kids' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending although i'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it

3	but at least it's exercise at least it has a little dash
3	like trying to buy life insurance for instance an endeavor notably lacking in dash call it the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible
3	over the past decade or two the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products variations on products and variations on the variations besides term life and whole life (the old standbys) we now have universal life universal variable life flexible adjustable universal life policies with persistency bonuses policies festooned with exotic riders living benefit policies and on and on
3	first generalize shorn of all their riders special provisions and other bells and whistles insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories: so-called pure insurance which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death and permanent insurance which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive
3	if all you want is death-benefit coverage pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck within limits it's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age
3	but term means just that the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires
3	if you flunk you may not be able to buy it even if you're healthy and can renew your premium will go up sharply because you're that much older
3	second the $5 760 i'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation amex not i would get the benefit of the investment income on my money
3	which goes to show that the first law applies in insurance as in anything else there is no free lunch there is only marketing
3	and in most cases a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is in effect paying the salesman's commission as well investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years largely because of this
3	the simplest most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy you pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing and your cash value and dividends grow over the years
3	hugely popular it is far more flexible than straight whole life i can adjust the amount of insurance i want against the amount going into investment
3	i can adjust the amount of insurance i want against the amount going into investment i can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year
3	so-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while i'm still alive
3	these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while i'm still alive some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays
3	some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer heart attarcks renal failure and kidney transplants
3	i compared one universal policy for $130 000 face amount from such an insurer american life insurance corp. of lincoln neb. with a similar offering from equitable life assurance society of the u.s. which operates through 11 000 commissioned salesmen after one year i could walk away from the ameritas policy with $792 but id get only $14 from the equitable
3	the difference is magnified by time too at age 65 when i'd stop paying premiums the ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $14 000 higher than the other even though the equitable's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate

3	with krenz we just don't know what to expect mr. krenz doesn't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the 52-year-old politburo member was selected last week to succeed erich honecker
3	according to east germany's adn news agency mr. krenz spoke to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged east germany could learn from moscow's glasnost policies already last week mr. krenz started overhauling east germany's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media
3	already last week mr. krenz started overhauling east germany's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media on thursday a day after he took office east german television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer
3	i hope he grows with the job the most important thing is that he have a chance
3	there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades unlike mr. honecker mr. krenz enjoys asking questions
3	he was later shown on television fielding questions at one point he asked a worker whether he thought east germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies
3	it's more than just travel people have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society
3	this same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting u.s. congressmen this spring rather than trying to lecture us says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting mr. krenz wanted to listen
3	rather than trying to lecture us mr. krenz wanted to listen he was particularly impressed by mr. krenz's ready admission that east germany needed to change

3	federal reserve critics used to complain of stop and go monetary policies that the fed would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt
3	such caution was evident after the recent friday-the-13th stock market plunge some bush administration officials urged mr. greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets
3	mr. greenspan's decision to keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the fed's ranks a senior fed official spoke on saturday after the market swoon to both the washington post and the new york times saying the fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed
3	ironically the anonymous official's comments have earned some plaudits for mr. greenspan at a hearing last week democratic sen. chris dodd of connecticut told treasury secretary nicholas brady that chairman greenspan's announcement over the oct. 13 weekend was a very important statement
3	when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets a surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system

3	exports which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years seem to have stalled factory payrolls and production fell in september
3	in addition the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road inflation may be stable at the moment running at about 4.5%.
3	so far mr. greenspan's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well his hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession
3	to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession we've gotten through two stock market crashes and we've gone through an election without any major problems
3	but such caution is no guarantee against mistakes the fed's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession perhaps starting early next year
3	if that happens chairman greenspan could well become an open target already congress is toying with legislation to curb the fed's independence

3	mr. guber and mr. peters don't have much to gain from a protracted battle sony for its part could decide that the cost of a warner settlement or court fight is too high choosing instead to find someone else to run columbia
3	but other murkier issues will play a big role sony and the guber-peters team are hanging much of their case on warner's willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up

3	general mills inc. the food giant launched a breakfast cereal called benefit containing psyllium oat wheat and beet bran the words reduce cholesterol were prominently displayed on its package
3	the flood of claims and counter-claims worried consumers and actually hurt sales of the new cereals that americans might someday in various forms ingest too much psyllium
3	currently there is a lull in the psyllium war the fda has asked kellogg and general mills to show research that their cereals are safe
3	but the agency hasn't yanked psyllium off store shelves if the fda approves the new uses of psyllium other companies are expected to rush to market with psyllium products
3	it's going to be a sensational thing says mr. krishnamurthy of p&g in bombay says psyllium exporter mr. patel: i just got back yesterday from the u.s.
3	but the news of the boom has yet to trickle down to the farmers they only know of one use for the crop as a laxative and with psyllium prices currently languishing in the wake of a bumper crop they think of the seed as a marginal crop something to grow between summer wheat crops
3	but there's a catch sidhpur and adjacent districts are the only places in the world where psyllium is grown in large quantities
3	this is partly due to the particular demands of the crop psyllium needs sandy soil dew during the first few weeks and then total dryness when its seeds are maturing
3	there are other spots on the globe and in india where the seed could be grown it's not a crop that can't be doubled or tripled

3	that mr. lawson's tax cuts would have profound effects on britain's international accounts and the value of sterling they increased the after-tax rate of return and made britain a far more attractive place to invest producing sudden capital inflows
3	so the british experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of albion we had been soliciting opinions on it long before mr. lawson's resignation and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy john major
3	we should also add mr. lawson's own explanation as we understand it unlike the u.s. britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages
3	unlike the u.s. britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages the wage stickiness which oecd studies confirm is particularly high in britain gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation
3	unlike the u.s. britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages. inflation is easier to spark and harder to control
3	perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates though of course in the event mr. lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound not restrain a strong one that mr. roberts not only chides the chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling but also led the chorus saying that mr. volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise
3	in fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial for example and perhaps he picked the wrong pound-dm rate for that matter perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency
3	for that matter perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency we sympathize with mrs. thatcher's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of west germany
3	we sympathize with mrs. thatcher's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of west germany perhaps the shock would have been less if they'd fixed to another low-tax deregulated supply-side economy
3	in particular shadowing a currency is anything but fixing it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility
3	this cannot be solved by provoking a further downturn; reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation our advice is this: immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money

3	the chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson resigned because prime minister thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser sir alan walters the opposition labor party leader neil kinnock in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the british lower class denounced mrs. thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her cabinet
3	the opposition labor party leader neil kinnock in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the british lower class denounced mrs. thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her cabinet the british press making a mountain out of a molehill precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying mrs. thatcher as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government
3	behind the silly posturing lies a real dispute mr. lawson and his european-minded colleagues want the british pound formally tied to the west german mark.
3	to keep the exchange rate pegged mr. lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15% this doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that mrs. thatcher's policies had created producing widespread disaffection and pushing labor ahead in the polls
3	the reason is simple when a country cuts tax rates it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency
3	it was fear of disturbing ems exchange-rate relationships that caused the chirac government in france to be timid about cutting tax rates edouard balladur the finance minister at the time was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-european for disturbing the linked european currency relationship
3	that after the top tax rate was cut to 40% the flow abroad of british capital slowed to 50 billion pounds ($79 billion at the current rate) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986 this change in the british capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency
3	the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of western financial circles during the 1980s the most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates
3	first comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency's value that was pushed up by tax-rate reduction. this policy is totally mindless

3	to blend the methodical marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies likely changes include more emphasis on research soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing
3	estee lauder inc. revlon inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times a year and since most products can be easily copied by competitors they're loath to test them with consumers
3	just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods it doesn't mean they are packaged goods they're really fashion items wrapped up in little jars
3	unilever and p&g are the habitats of organization men in gray-flannel suits both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research
3	both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research. both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as soaps and diapers -- to the extent that some industry consultants predict cents-off coupons for mascara could result from their entry into the field
3	p&g already has shown it can meld some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the image-making of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business consider oil of olay which p&g acquired as part of richardson-vicks international in 1985
3	goliaths like unilever and p&g have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals next year noxell plans to roll out a perfume called navy
3	without p&g's backing noxell might not have been able to spend the estimated $5 million to $7 million needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands packaged-goods companies will make it tougher for smaller people to remain competitive
3	further consolidations in the industry could follow rumors that unilever is interested in acquiring schering-plough corp. 's maybelline unit are widespread
3	nearly 70% of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets according to andrew shore an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc that figure has been inching up for several years
3	that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands there will be more emphasis on quality
3	but success for unilever and p&g is far from guaranteed as shown by the many consumer-product companies that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business in the 1970s several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies including colgate-palmolive co. eli lilly & co. pfizer inc. and schering-plough acquired cosmetics companies

3	that at least at the federal level political ticket splitting has been on the rise over the past half century in only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20% of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the white house than for the house of representatives.
3	as we know voters tend to favor republicans more in races for president than in those for congress in every presidential election over the past half century except for the goldwater presidential candidacy the gop has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for congress
3	if these assumptions hold voters in races for congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner's dilemma and have an incentive at the margin to lean democratic if they put a republican into office not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from bringing home the bacon to their respective constituencies
3	second it explains why voters hold congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives any individual legislator's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency
3	the one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman republicans brought into office in 1980 by the reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982 because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the reagan revolution -- in national policy making they were more vulnerable to defeat
3	fourth the theory indicates why the republican party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a democratic opponent
3	fifth the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the south to the extent that democratic legislators from the south have held a disproportionate share of power in congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies voters in the south have had an especially strong incentive to keep such democrats in office
3	finally the theory suggests why republicans generally have fared better in senate races than in campaigns for the house since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of congress this is precisely the pattern one would expect if republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their democratic counterparts
3	this is indeed what the data indicate particularly in the case of the house the democratic house attendance rate has not exceeded the republican house attendance rate since 1959
3	moreover ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level state government is more typically split along republican-governor/democratic-legislature lines than the reverse

3	reversing an eight-year federal policy the measure supports medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest but mr. bush has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother's life is in danger mr. bush's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided house but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill

3	perhaps most important carl icahn who had once threatened a hostile takeover bid was subdued he and mr. roderick were even dining out together
3	whose fortunes have changed abruptly mr. icahn the company's deep-pocketed tenacious adversary recently disclosed that he had raised his usx stake to 13.1% and he again threatened a takeover
3	in addition usx's giant steel segment is facing softening demand and slipping prices as well as increasing competition from foreign steelmakers and low-cost minimills demand and slipping the import quotas got only a 2 1/2-year extension
3	without being pushed into unwelcome moves mr. corry might have to dismember the company more than he wants to

3	the 57-year-old tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief executive an undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he couldn't stand cutting up frogs mr. corry wanted to work for a big company that could do big things

3	nevertheless mr. corry once named chief executive didn't waste any time distancing himself from his former boss soon after taking over last june mr. corry rescinded a pay cut imposed on clerical workers a move that mr. roderick hadn't made in spite of improved earnings

3	however even usx executives who work closely with him aren't sure about his long-term goals i don't think he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go one says
3	when negotiating mr. corry played his cards close to the vest how his boss would routinely ask a subordinate to research an entire industry to target acquisition candidates. what he really wanted to know was about a particular company but you didn't know that.

3	if the cia has become a protection service for mr. noriega the american people ought to know what went wrong in panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry

3	this year's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings his study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34%
3	obviously we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market wasn't so risky that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds
3	that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds the junk market is no bonanza as drexel claimed but it also isn't a disaster as the doomsayers say

3	the wall street journal's american way of buying survey this year found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products they use for the survey peter d. hart research associates asked some 2 000 consumers including mrs. lombardi whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty.

3	there are two versions of measure for measure on stage at the alley theater here one is a strong vigorous portrayal of shakespeare's play; the other is director gregory boyd's overlay of present-day punk rock decadence on old vienna
3	measure for measure is one of shakespeare's problem plays so named because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy comedy or history its ambiguity and uneasy mixture of the serious and the comic is no doubt one reason why it is very much in vogue with directors just now
3	featuring a rectangular platform of white-washed boards that extends into the audience when the action requires a prison cell consisting of an enlarged wire cage rolls forward on iron wheels on the platform
3	in the play's major scenes mr. boyd demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the shakespearean dynamic when isabella (ellen lauren) confronts her brother claudio (matt loney) in his cell explaining the price she has been asked to secure his freedom; when isabella and the disguised duke (philip kerr) conspire to trick angelo; and when mariana (annalee jefferies) a woman wronged by angelo confronts him with his past misdeeds the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence
3	in his measure mr. boyd has modernized the pimps and prostitutes of vienna whom angelo is supposed to bring under control by converting them into transvestites punk rockers and heavy metal types with a strong emphasis on leather chains and porno-inspired costumes loud rock music accompanies all the scene changes even those in the convent
3	when claudio is arrested he is brought on stage nude except for the manacles on his wrists and ankles when the opportunist lucio (jack stehlin) visits the convent to inform isabella of her brother's fate lucio not only slaps the mother superior on her rear but brings along a voluptuous companion (jill powell) not in shakespeare's script to undulate lasciviously
3	what's more it represents an important step for the alley theater measure for measure is mr. boyd's first directorial assignment as the theater's new artistic director he succeeded pat brown who was fired by the alley board 18 months ago.
3	who was fired by the alley board 18 months ago her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led peter zeisler head of theatre communications group to write an editorial in american theatre magazine condemning the board

3	when they talk mega-issues they're truly talking mega the capital market is booming
3	but the mega-issues are raising megaquestions about the rapidly evolving indian capital market one is whether there is enough money to fund the new issues without depressing stock trading
3	moreover in the relatively unregulated indian stock markets investors frequently don't know what they are getting when they subscribe to an issue a prospectus in india doesn't always tell a potential investor much
3	a prospectus in india doesn't always tell a potential investor much some of the large amounts are being raised by small firms
3	some analysts are concerned that the mega-issues in such an unregulated environment could lead to a mega-crash the rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the mega-projects says g.s. patel a former chairman of the giant government-run mutual fund the unit trust of india

3	when mr. gandhi came to power he ushered in new rules for business he said industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside india and benefit from economies of scale.
3	india's overregulated businessmen had to be persuaded but they have started to think big and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past
3	some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first fruits of mr. gandhi's policy and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past the industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the capital market which is a far cheaper source of funds than government-controlled banks where interest rates for prime borrowers are around 16%
3	the second factor spurring mega-issues is political mr. gandhi has called general elections for november and many businessmen fear that he and his congress (i) party will lose
3	that some of the money raised in the current spate of issues will be used as campaign donations before the elections but india's industrialists have a history of making under-the-table campaign donations
3	so far the mega-issues are a hit with investors earlier this year tata iron & steel co. 's offer of $355 million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed

3	administration officials traveling with president bush in costa rica interpreted mr. ortega's wavering as a sign that he isn't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections mr. abrams said that mr. ortega is seeking to demobilize the contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections

3	unhappily our gardeners for ages have suffered at the hands of the decorative artist when applying his `designs' to the garden it is this adapting of absurd `knots' and patterns from old books to any surface where a flower garden has to be made that leads to bad and frivolous design -- wrong in plan and hopeless for the life of plants
3	but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible the white house had the perfect case but congress blinked before it could go to court
3	after the hud and s&l stories broke some congressmen began to worry that their influence peddling at executive-branch and independent agencies might some day get them in trouble they worried about an interior department directive to log all communications with members or their staffs
3	when it threatened to use this provision as the test for a line-item veto congress caved the fear congress has of any line-item-veto test led members to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this year this section shall be effective only on oct. 1 1989

3	recent data from new york city provide more of the picture while by no means the highest crime community in the country new york is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small-business development
3	a survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by interface a policy research organization it gave 1 124 businesses a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses

3	the new york study's companies averaged 27 employees their annual crime losses averaged about $15 000 with an additional $8 385 annual cost in security

3	the vicious cycle that national institute of justice director james k. stewart calls crime causing poverty underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities contributing to the poverty of local residents.
3	bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $1 000 per worker compared with one-third that amount for firms with more than 10 employees
3	one is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses the number one proposal for reducing crime in the new york survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents
3	for cities losing business to suburban shopping centers it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such hot spots of pedestrian density
3	increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such hot spots of pedestrian density with national institute of justice support the minneapolis police and the crime control institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols

3	the thrifts had a combined loss of $487.8 million in the second quarter other lenders have been recovering only 50 cents to 60 cents on the dollar on foreclosed arizona property if they can sell it at all
3	all this havoc is the result of one of the worst busts in arizona's boom-and-bust history compounded by some of the usual suspects in 1980s banking debacles: greed fraud and plain bad banking in the late 1970s and early 1980s lenders and developers poured money into office buildings condominiums and massive tracts of raw desert land confident that arizona's population would grow at annual rates of 4% to 6% for years to come

3	football has long been mr. jones's passion both on and off the field an arkansas native he started at guard on the undefeated 1964 university of arkansas team that won a national championship
3	so it wasn't surprising that mr. jones returned to his arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for mr. landry he tapped jimmy johnson a teammate on the 1964 university of arkansas squad and the head coach at the university of miami
3	whatever mr. johnson's talents in the hearts and minds of many dallas fans he is no tom landry seven games (and after a loss to the kansas city chiefs yesterday seven losses) into the season the new cowboys aren't doing any better than the old
3	in fact the last time they played this badly was in 1960 their opening season average attendance at their games about 49 000 last year continues flat
3	mr. jones is attacking the problem on several fronts he continues to reshuffle the team trading famed running back herschel walker to the minnesota vikings this month for a slew of players and future draft picks

3	mr. jones has been taking prospective suite owners onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with players and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider's look at the team's strategy before game time the sales job seems to be paying off: when he bought the team only six of the suites had been sold
3	the biggest is the nfl's contract with national television for broadcast of the league's games last year the cowboys' share of that pie came to $17.6 million
3	the team additionally earns between $2 million and $4 million for local radio and television broadcast rights mr. jones is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights
3	mr. jones is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days he calls the contracts critical to winning in the nfl and has played his part in the bidding wars
3	and has played his part in the bidding wars besides signing mr. aikman to a sizable contract mr. jones has agreed to pay rookie quarterback steve walsh $4.1 million over the next four years
3	to tackle the problem nfl owners have proposed setting a rookie wage scale to try to rein in salaries but each player would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability
3	but each player would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance
3	the owners are trying to boost profit in other ways too many have launched promotions to attract new fans and are renegotiating dated stadium contracts
3	the changes haven't come easy like the game of professional football the nfl organization itself is in turmoil
3	and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock in july 11 nfl owners almost all of them new blocked an effort to install jim finks as a replacement for retiring league commissioner pete rozelle
3	and his work style seems to support that he puts in busy six-day weeks (excluding game days) and on one recent afternoon fielded questions in the course of an hour from a tv producer his luxury-suite marketing manager a disgruntled customer and a roomful of arkansas reporters
3	he puts in busy six-day weeks to keep his schedule on track he flies two personal secretaries in from little rock to augment his staff in dallas

3	it turns out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer this basic research will begin showing results there soon
3	the story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s when a pediatrician named alfred g. knudson jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects he theorized that in the eye cancer an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other
3	dr. knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome no. 13 from a parent who had had the disease under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing
3	he believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple hits on cancer suppressor genes because it often seems to develop in stages it often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages
3	gradually a coherent picture of cancer development emerged if both copies of a certain gene were knocked out benign polyps would develop
3	if both copies of a certain gene were knocked out benign polyps would develop if both copies of a second gene were then deleted the polyps would progress to malignancy
3	that several years earlier a princeton university researcher arnold levine had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones the deletion dr. vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53
3	evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers too researchers in edinburgh scotland have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies
3	the p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene
3	at the same time the johns hopkins team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes dr. vogelstein hopes soon to isolate one on chromosome 18 also involved in colon cancer

3	but through this period so far as the u.s. military was concerned mr. noriega was a model recruit he signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under american officers at fort gulick in panama in july 1967 according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details mr. noriega has since classified as secret
3	he became gen. torrijos's inseparable shadow and the holder of all panama's secrets mr. noriega by now a lieutenant colonel expanded his contacts to include the cubans -- not to mention the israelis the taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking
3	early on in the state department we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of cuba and the united states some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the cubans

3	during the reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the cubans and the sandinistas he allegedly entered into panama's first formal business arrangement with colombian drug bosses according to floyd carlton a pilot who once worked for mr. noriega and who testified before the u.s. grand jury in miami that would ultimately indict the panamanian on drug charges
3	but mr. noriega was convinced the reagan white house wouldn't act against him because he had an insurance policy: his involvement with the contra rebels in nicaragua the general allowed the contras to set up a secret training center in panama
3	although his help for the contra cause was limited it was enough to win him important protectors in the reagan administration noriega played u.s. intelligence agencies and the u.s. government like a violin
3	an incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which mr. noriega might have maintained such influence with washington -- by compromising u.s. officials curtin windsor then the ambassador to costa rica recalls being invited to panama by mr. noriega's brother luis carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and quiet serious conversation on the aswara peninsula
3	yet his political setbacks mounted mr. noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of hugo spadafora his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger mr. noriega on drug trafficking charges
3	in late 1986 he made an offer he thought the u.s. couldn't refuse mr. noriega offered to assassinate the sandinista leadership in exchange for a promise to help clean up noriega's image and a commitment to lift the {u.s.} ban on military sales to the panamanian defense forces
3	within weeks the unfolding iran-contra scandal took away mr. noriega's insurance policy the death of cia director william casey and resignation of oliver north allowed anti-noriega political forces to gain influence

3	solo woodwind players have to be creative if they want to work a lot because their repertoire and audience appeal are limited the oboist heinz holliger has taken a hard line about the problem: he commissions and splendidly interprets fearsome contemporary scores and does some conducting so he doesn't have to play the same mozart and strauss concertos over and over again
3	richard stoltzman has taken a gentler more audience-friendly approach years ago he collaborated with the new music gurus peter serkin and fred sherry in the very countercultural chamber group tashi which won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like messiaen's quartet for the end of time
3	and now goes on the road with piano bass a slide show and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop with a few notable exceptions just the thing for the vivaldi-at-brunch set the yuppie audience that has embraced new age as its very own easy listening

3	nissan's market share in japan had been dropping year by year since the beginning of the decade its u.s. sales sagged partly because of price increases due to the rising yen

3	nissan started advertising infiniti fully eight months before the cars hit american showrooms the ads featured fences rocks and pussy-willow buds -- almost anything but the cars themselves
3	on the other hand nissan's sales goals for infiniti are modest compared with toyota's targets for lexus nissan will build only about 3 500 of the $38 000 infiniti q45 sedans each month sending about 2 000 of them to the u.s. and keeping the rest for sale in japan.
3	infiniti is nissan's big business move for the 21st century and we're in no hurry to generate large profits right away despite plans to add two new infiniti models next year bringing the total to four infiniti won't show profits for at least five years
3	nissan had record net income of 114.63 billion yen ($868 million) in the fiscal year ended last march 31 a remarkable recovery from the 20.39 billion yen of two years earlier when the company lost money on operations nissan has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in japanese car sales
3	the big reason: for all its cost-cutting nissan remains less efficient than toyota in its last fiscal year nissan's profit represented just 2.3% of sales compared with 4.3% at toyota
3	we are in a transitional phase from being a japanese company to becoming an international company based in japan that nissan will soon establish a holding company overseeing all u.s. operations just as it's doing in europe

3	both general motors corp. and ford motor co. have been trying to amass 15% stakes in jaguar ford which already has an unwelcome 13.2% holding is prepared to bid for the entire company and had lobbied the government to lift the takeover restrictions early
3	jaguar shares skyrocketed yesterday after mr. ridley's announcement in late trading the shares were up a whopping 122 pence ($1.93) -- a 16.3% gain -- to a record 869 pence on very heavy volume of 9.7 million shares
3	speculation about a takeover fight has sent jaguar shares soaring in the past six weeks the share price was languishing at about 400 pence before ford's sept. 19 announcement of its interest in a minority stake

3	that holders representing 75% of the shares voting at a special shareholders' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions that ford as jaguar's largest shareholder now has the power to call for such a meeting
3	that ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid jaguar's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened because fewer than 3% of its shares are owned by employees and management
3	the conservative government's decision may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election expected in late 1991 it's now a very good time politically to get this over and done with

3	mr. ridley hinted at this motive in answering questions from members of parliament after his announcement he said he was giving up the golden share to clear the way so the playing field is level between all contestants
3	his policies went beyond his control and resulted . . . in riots and disturbances and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment i am not a proponent of everything gandhi did but some of his law breaking was justified because india was then under occupation by a foreign power and indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally affected them
3	there may be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it the case of rosa parks the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus comes to mind as an illustration
3	it is true that both are non-violent but there is a fundamental difference between them lawful demonstrations such as peaceful picketing and other assemblages that do not disturb the peace or cause a public nuisance or interfere with the rights of others are rights guaranteed by any truly free system of government.
3	but before we get on with that let me make just a few tangential remarks about lawful demonstrations they are useful to call public attention to grievances but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute
3	at best demonstrations are overused and boringly uninformative at worst they can become the stimuli that lead to law breaking
3	soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in mob mania there are better ways to promote a cause
3	assume a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involving a police car the protesters lie down in the street blocking traffic and will not move until the authorities carry them away
3	assume that a tv network is airing a celebrity interview program with a live audience the politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of rancor amid certain groups
3	the network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige the demonstrators have been non-violent but the result of their trespasses has been to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with their dispute
3	geraldo or phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protesters let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only harms other people indirectly yet does irreparable damage to the nation as a whole
3	let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only harms other people indirectly yet does irreparable damage to the nation as a whole those young men who chose to disobey their country's call to arms during the vietnam war and fled to canada or some other sanctuary to avoid combat
3	to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law and no second invitation will be required
3	this brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause
3	here is a good rule of thumb: if the movement produced the leader the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement in either case ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience

3	the clash is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in japan's once-cozy financial circles not only are japan's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work
3	not only are japan's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work increasingly they're squaring off against one another in unprecedented public fashion
3	what triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a new zealand government bond issue nomura was attempting to organize the 50 billion-yen ($352 million) borrowing in japan at a time when many japanese banks led by industrial bank of japan were pressuring the wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by new zealand's civil-service pension fund.
3	new zealand's finance minister david caygill lashed out at such suggestions he told reporters in wellington tuesday that the government hadn't guaranteed the loans to dfc new zealand ltd. an investment bank 80%-owned by the national provident fund and wouldn't bail it out.
3	no less significant than the japanese banks' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between japan securities and banking industries anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the two industries from each other
3	in the past year both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses nomura started a credit-card venture with american express co. that allowed cardholders to use their nomura securities accounts like a bank account attracting the wrath of banks.

3	in between came lots of coffee drinking while watching the balloons inflate and lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order (the baskets hold no more than four passengers when it wasn't my turn in the balloon i followed its progress from the chase car listening to the driver holler into a walkie-talkie
3	after long stretches of this attendant ground activity came 20 or so lovely minutes of drifting above the vosges watching the silver mists rise off the river and the french cows amble about the fields it's hard not to feel that god's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing out how belle it all was
3	that you can't steer. you can go only up or down and ride the air currents
